  text: It has taken over 3 weeks for any real Western or World pressure to affect this war. And how? Not by the UN, diplomacy or sanctions. Many innocent civilians have died, lately Lebanese children. Why does the UN exist? Why does Israel ignore humanitarian law? Why do the Hisbollah strike against soft targets? Both parties should be ashamed to recognised as human. They should heed their 'Good book' and not kill their own kind. Until their minds are given aid, the senseless killing will go on.

  text: Is the International reaction enough? Enough for what? Enough to make the conflict worse? Yes. Enough to ensure hundreds of families die, are injured or lose everything they've worked for? Certainly. Enough to promote hate in the hearts of many, and to strengthen fundamentalist attitudes on both sides? Absolutely. Enough to prevent a workable solution taking place any time soon? without doubt. The international reaction has been more than enough.

The lack of definitive action by either the US or UK to stop this atrocious indiscriminate action by Israel is discraceful given the power these governments wield.

These nations have been warmongering since biblical times-and they still hold the same grievances. And then bleat on about the international community helping them They don't want help-they just want us to take sides. And the US has taken Israels side, while Blair, the inveterate coward, minces in the background. Disgusting, every last man jack of them.

Although Crisis Talks may temporarely stop war, it won't bring a solid peace. International forces would only be directed according to US interests (wich also indirecltly tells Israel what to do), so that wouldn't help Lebanon. USA is using Israel to say this war is not theirs. My government (Brazil) needs to be diplomaticaly against Israel.

Every time peace appears to be at hand, something happens ande the fire is reignited.  It appears the only way this conflict will end is when Hizbullah and the Israeli army agree to fight it out directly, preferably somewhere away from towns and villages.

But in the available time the Israeli forces can only trace where the missiles are fired from, they can't ascertain if the launch site is full of civilians, especially when warnings of possible strikes<br />have already been given in the hope that civilians can avoid<br />such zones.

  text: I am not taking anybody's side, but think it is helpful to know the truth. To those who don't know the reason why Hiz has kidnapped the 2 soldiers,Israel 'illegally' holds hundreds of Lebanese citizens in its jails since its 'illegal' invasion of Southern Lebanon many years ago. The Lebanese gov had tried for so many years through diplomacy to secure the release of their POW's, but had been unable to do so.

  text: Hezbollah hides amongst the locals and this makes them partly responsible.  Israel says they were targeting a missile launch site.  If this is the case, where is the evidence?  The concern and belief of most people is that Israel is targeting sites indiscriminantly.  If this is not the case, then Israel must reveal some of the data that led them to their actions.  If they cannot then we must assume that they waging indiscrminant war on Lebanon.

They should look closer at Ireland where the only way peace was obtained and the guns destroyed was through political means and dialogue. Killing a parent or worse a child will not solve anything. If it was your relation?

  text: I think the whole middle east confict is sending a message that whatever the policitians claim about humanity, justice and moral issues, the foundamental truth is that if you have power, then you can do whatever you want and claim your opposition as terorrists. It is sad, but it is the truth. I also can they the US's strategy. It is using Isarel and Hezebollah to humilate or weaken Iran and Syrian who they could not just invade like they did in Iraq.

  text: I can't but notice the unmistakeable propaganda adopted by Israel/USA to blame others for crimes they have committed and continue to commit. Would it not be more dignified to take responsibility of the crimes being committed against civilians in their "precision" bombing? We all know that the tactics adopted in their war against Hez are wrong, no one can win from the air. The conclusion is that IDF can't win a ground battle against Hez, hence the air, which means more civilian casualities.

If Israeli intelligence has information that Hizbollah is in a particular location before they bomb it, don't they also have information that civilians are in that area too. Either its pure sloppy missile firing, poor intelligence or Israel doesn't care if civilians are killed in order to reach their objective of eliminating the enemy. You simply CANNOT bomb a place just like that and then say it was a mistake!

We have learned from history that when terrorist organisations are given time, they use it to prepare for their next attack, by getting money and weapons, and they plan. This planning is not random, it is complicated and strategic in order to further their terrorism. Hezbollah will only place more launching sites around civilians, and attack with more, later. Would not a ceasefire mean negotiating with Hezbollah, a terrorist group? Not acceptable.

If they operate under direct orders from Iran or Syria, then these states are responsible for any war crimes done by Hezbollah. But, if your enemy is a war criminal, is it ok for you to become one as well? Shouldn't Israel rethink this whole madness? Couldn't their secret service try to assassinate leaders or sabotage <br />Hezbollah, instead of this massacre?

  text: How can we in the West allow this barbaric slaughter of innocent civilians? Years of turmoil in the region doesn't warrant the death of civilians in the name of peace, a complex situation, or financial gain... no matter which side you're on.<br />This slaughter proves once again that we are unable to progress from being a barbaric, primitive species.

If the so called Smart bombs are supposed to be that accurate then this target was accurate and deliberate !! Hope  the world sees it for what it really is, which is  nothing but a disguised genocide of the Lebanese people.

However, Israel goes to unimaginable lengths to minimise the deaths of civilians by for instance foregoing the element of suprise and informing civilians to leave before an attack.  <br /><br />Israel's aim is to minimise civilain casualties and offers its sincere apologies when they do occur.  Hezbollah and other terrorist groups deliberately target civilians and rejoice upon their death.

Using civilian places to shoot rockets is as criminal and heinous as raiding them in retaliation.

  text: After so much false promise, false diplomasy and biased critisism, the true nature of international opinion is being shown...how short are our memories? Why should a nation give at the negociation table again and again, then be spat at, lied to and invaded unsuccessfully by its neigbours? War has many faces, all of them ugly. But it is a war and has been since 1948. Israel has to be strong or it will die.

  text: The reason their are so many civilian deaths in Lebanon is the Israelis are doing the same as the Americans do rain down missiles and bombs and wipe the place clean, they know the enemy doesn't have the weapons they have and the Americans and Israelis troops are either cowards or they are not good enough to take the enemy on one on one, so they can't send their troops in to do selective bombing, as a result the Isralies are quite happy to kill babies.<br />.

The argument that Hesbollah will use a ceasefire to regroup and consolidate is pure cynicism, much as I sympathise with the equally innocent victims on the Israeli side.

  text: It is embarassing that the UK Government has not yet demanded an immediate end to this barbarism. This is state sponsored terrorism without limit. Since when did it become acceptable to murder innocent civilians just to punish the guilty? Once again international law seems to mean nothing when it comes to Israel. I hope one day those responsible, and particularly the Israeli government officials who should be capable of restraint, are held accountable in a war crimes tribunal.

  text: Any moral human being would feel sorry for the death of innocent children. However, before putting all the blame on the Israelis, one needs to recognize that Hezbollah were the one's who put them in danger in the first place by using them as human shields. The same applies to the UN outpost. Hezbollah had been firing rockets into Israel from 3 meters in front of the building just minutes before. It amazes me how people just sit at home and blame Israel for all that goes wrong in the Middle East.

Until the UN can stop this massacre even if it opposes the US and Isreal, I would consider it (the UN) completely powerless. The only ones paying for this are the innocent killed in the bombings.

The rules of war must be changed when countries allow terrorists to act from their territory. The Arab world must understand once and for all that the whole population is considered an enemy, when they ignore terror.

Israel regrets but it provides no solace for the victims.<br /><br />Why can't the Hezbollah hold its rocket attacks on Israeli civilians.  Their animosity brings no peace but wider war.<br /><br />All it takes is for both Israel and Hezbollah to take a step back - just a little common sense from all.

Why is the Lebanese Army not defending it's own country from an armed group acting without consent of the government? Why are they not defending their "innocent civilians"? The Lebanese have abdicated their responsiblility for the security of their country by allowing Hezbollah to dictate their foreign policy.

To kill and go on killing. Even as a child I was taught that this is not right. War is failure - always. Lebanon is our failure.

  text: I don't know how some Americans can continue to support the Bush Administration and Israel, after all of the carnage they have caused. Israel and its supporters were largely responsible for the invasion of Iraq, which has killed more than 2,500 US soldiers so far. If a wider war breaks out, the casualty rate will be much higher. The reputation of the US is mud throughout the world. It wouldn't surprise me if  Hezbollah and Hamas are more popular than the America right now.

  text: Who is winning the argument in the media? Apparently Hezbollah is when the lamestream media echoes their propoganda and neglects to show the suffering of the Israelis. One gets the impression that the whole of Lebanon has be carpet bombed and levelled. Not true. But the press continues to display 'old' images over and over again suggesting they are 'new' damages. Then Hezbollah operates under the cover of the Red Cross, fires from UN Posts, and use civilians as 'sheilds'. The media has been used

  text: I hope that so-called "International" Court in Hague will indict Israel and their generals for CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, TRIAL THEM, and PUT BEHIND BARS, at least 1 of them. If not, it is sure that the Court serves US goals only, and its credibility is zero. The economic emabargo to Israel must be imposed by the rest of the world until Israel returns all stolen land, release all prisoners, and trial their politicians and generals for crimes against humanity.

  text: When acts of terror are retaliated with acts of even more terror, you join a vicious, never-ending cycle of suffering, acrimony, and a complete loss of humanity. To find lasting peace in its region Israel must find means of negotiation based on diplomacy, dialogue, and compromise. <br />India, a victim of Pakistan state-sponsored Islamic terrorism, has proactively engaged its neighbour in peace talks. This move has brought the two people closer than ever before. There is a lesson it for Israel.

People blame the immediate cause - Israeli bombs aimed at rocket launchers - rather than those who deliberately place those launchers in the garages of civilian apartment buildings, specifically to draw fire.  Hezbollah uses innocent Lebanese children as front line victims in their immoral, manipulative propaganda war.  Put the responsibility where it belongs.

Israel for bombing civilian buildings based on the flimsiest intelligence or even on mere suppositions.  By doing this, Israel is only playing in the hands of the Hezbollah.

  text: Those people around the world who's views were neither for or against the Israelis or Palestinians, I am sure now, see the Israelis as the villains of a violent conflict. I, for one, always took a 50/50 view on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict but the events over the last few weeks have completely changed my mind set -never use the shield of self defense as a means to inflict violence and sorrow on others -Israel, you have just made it worse for yourself. The world is against you

  text: Secretary Rice is quoted as deeply sad about the lifes of innocent civilians, on the other hand she is for continued hostility and against cease fire. What a hypocrisy?

  text: Where was the press when thousands of Lebanese celebrated the Hezbollah kidnapping of Israeli soldiers from Israeli soil?  The Hizbollah crossed the 6-year quiet border, killed 4 soldiers and kidnapped 2 others, and the the streets of Beirut saw an outbreak of joy!! <br /><br />Three years ago, when Hizbollah kidnapped 3 Israeli soldiers, Israel reacted with "restraint", as so many of your comments suggest.  Look where we find ourselves now!!  Terrorists interpret restraint as a green light.

  text: The death toll in Lebanon is nothing compared to how many civilians are killed weekly in Iraq by so called 'freedom fighters' The BBC don't publicise that side of the story as they are an appendage of the Islamic Lobby in the UK.  This comment won't be published anyway for the same reason. <br /><br />I'm a BBC license fee payer stop publishing one-sided comments from Muslims in the Middle East and UK only. I don't live in fear of Jewish terror in my own country.

  text: "I don't want to condone Israel's recent painful mistakes, but a few questions:  What act started this most recent crisis?  Why does Hizbollah hide behind civilians and UN targets? Why do many Europeans preference Palestinian and Lebanese civilian lives over Israeli civilian lives?  Why is it OK for Hamas/Hizbollah (w/ Iran/Syria support) to do what they do, (purposefully target innocents) but the granted horrible mistakes of Israel trying to target evil hiding behind children is a worse crime?"

  text: I'd like to know if the people complaining about the Israeli actions in Lebanon would be complaining about Hezbollah's actions on Israel had Israel simply sat back and done NOTHING at all in retaliation. Would they be calling for a ceasefire? Would they be labelling this as genocide? Would they be calling for an end to the indiscriminate murdering of civilians? Or is it only okay if Jews are on the receiving end?

  text: Kathy Megan, states, that she fully supports, the actions being taken by Israel, " you can't make an omlette without breaking eggs" does that mean she support the mass murder of women and children? Why when one group does this, they are classed as a terrorist group, but when Isreal does it, its "collatoral damage" or maybe it is becuase Israel has the Backing of the USA, so therefore they can do what they like and call it what they like.
