  text: Since no one has any real idea of how drugs affect people in the long term how would they be classified? Simple answer all Drugs not on prescription of Chemist control are banned with no classification and the those on prescription remain under the control of the Act. In otherwords Class A is all unprescribed and uncontrolled drugs and Class B are all drugs that are prescribed. Class C are all drugs released for sale through outlets.

  text: To simply say tax drugs and make them legal would not solve anything.Criminal elements would still smuggle drugs in the country just like they they do with tobacco and alcohol to undercut the taxed goods.To those people who say addicts only harm themselves,what about their famillies who have to watch them die,and what about the NHS who have to fund their treatment with limited funds.What is needed is proper education and decent role models for our children allied to life sentences to the dealers

  text: The government seems to miss the point that most drugs used sensibly and in moderation can bring enjoyment and benefit to people taking them. Drug USE is good, drug ABUSE is bad.  Banning substances altogether doesn't stop people taking them and fails to provide guidelines for safe use.  Every prescription drug comes with instructions and warnings on the bottle, just about every chemical substance on the planet can harm if used in the wrong way. Inform the public dont patronise them.

I listen to the news daily for some time now.  I have heard of our people dying from everything BUT marijuana!!  It is ridiculous for the government to think it can totally eradicate the drug trade.  It is more efficient to restructure the system and save some of the lives we are losing.

  text: Keeping marijuna illegal is just hurting the economy. The government is spending millions a year to try and stop the sale and use of marijuna when they could be selling it and taxing it and making millions from it. Crime would drop dramatically and would free up prisons. They say if marijuana was made legal more kids and teenagers would use it. But if you ask any teenager what is easier to get marijuana or alcohol they will tell you marijuana. Theres no age limit to buy off the street.

The solution is clear: legalisation, regulation and taxation, but none of the powers that be have the courage to do it."

  text: Some of the so-called 'drugs' listed are not drugs at all, but substances that have valid non-drug use, e.g. solvents or glue. It would be counter-productive to ban these outright, but there should be much tighter restrictions on their sale, perhaps restricting them to over-21s (with ID required). Offending suppliers (e.g. DIY stores) would be closed down, to make them take extra care who they sell these substances to. That alone wouldn't stop their abuse, but it would help reduce it.

  text: Drug reclassification poses an interesting problem; you'd end up with only two real options. Legalise drugs less harmful than the legal drugs cigarettes and alcohol, or ban the latter two (certain drugs available on prescription of course). Personally I think you should ban smoking and alcohol, but then everyone has a vice. People (such as myself) do just as much damage by being obese and chocoholics. Where does excessive weight or chocolate intake appear on the chart?

  text: Now that alcohol and tobacco are officially considered dangerous why don't we make them both illegal? Because they're a good taxable income and our government doesn't want us to stop drinking or smoking. This system is outdated because drug trends change constantly. Ketamine isn't a new drug, its been used in nightclubs for years yet research has only just caught up with it. How can we introduce a new system of classification when the people who set it are so out of touch with modern drug use?

  text: The drug problem has to put into perspective. In Scotland about one person per day dies of drug abuse, but six people a day died of alcohol abuse in 2004 (latest figures I have). Frankly, I can't see this proposal being effective. If we can't solve the legal abuse problem, then we sure aren't going to solve the illegal ones with this kind of initiative. Personally I think it is impossible to resolve. Legalisation would at least kill the drug trade and reduce crime.

  text: Jennifer wrote "The only people in favour of legalisation are drug takers..."<br /><br />I don't take drugs, don't smoke, drink but rarely, and favour legalisation, so your assertion is false. You don't need to be a drug user to see that the current system has the opposite effect to its intended aims. Prohibition doesn't work; it creates a black market free of checks on quality, and free of accountability. I choose not to partake, but that in itself doesn't give me, or you, a right to forbid others.

Our towns and cities have become violent places because of our culture of binge drinking. Anyone who supports prohibition of cannabis must also support prohibition of alcohol. It is _undoubtedly_ more harmful to our society. If folks dislike the mindless binge drinking culture, let them relax at home with a quiet spliff and THINK about our world. There's a reason hippies have compassion

The debate here is on classification, not legality or punichment. By having a serious look at the physiological and psychological effects of all kinds of drug use from caffeine to cocaine we can hopefully dispel myths on the harm that some drugs can do and the real damage that the likes of alcohol can do and work towards a healthy balanced society.

Alcohol use is rapidly increasing, especially in the young, because we don't treat it as if it were a drug. The new classification system needs to include alcohol, which in my opinion os probably far worse for society than Marijuana.

  text: Taking drugs is a choice.  Yes they are addictive but no one forces you to try them in the first place and many are try once and be hooked.  So long as this message is clear the majority of drugs should be legalised over the counter and taxed accordingly.  At least this way the quality and composition of the drug can be controlled and the criminal element is severely reduced.  The taxed money can then be put into addiction and support centres.  People will always take drugs, let's deal with it.

  text: the idea of a scale of mean harm rating is absurd and could lead to people making equally rediculous conclusions about drugs (for instance the low score for the v. dangerous LSD). the law rightly forbids the use of recreational drugs to try to control their use to excess by the young and the naive. those who maturely take soft drugs are left to do so discretely for the majority of the time. its a cop out  but is a best attempt at a problem that isnt as black and white as some would like.

It's time we use our common sense and realise that the demand for recreational drugs is never going to go away. What we need to do is formulate a method of supply that minimizes the risks of drug use, and of the 'war on drugs' on our society as a whole. <br />Granted, the proposed policy change is not doing enough to end counter productive drug policy, but it's certainly a step in the right direction.

It certainly does not help when the government allows the sale of dangerous drugs such as tobacco and alcohol, sending a rather confused message to the public. The dealers need to be removed from the street and potential dealers dissuaded with the introduction of extremely harsh penalties. This would reduce the use of drugs greatly.

  text: It's unbelievable that magic mushrooms were ever illegalised, never mind classified as "Class A" drugs. These are a natural and traditional part of British culture and have no negative side effects. We should have every right to gather wild magic mushrooms and consume them as we wish.

  text: As per usual, there are quite a few people posting here without a clue about the real effects of drugs, only what they read in their favourite paper. The truth is that most of the illegal drugs, especially the recreational ones (such as ecstasy) shouldn't even be illegal, let alone (in the case of ecstasy) class A. Try to learn the truth about this subject before spouting about the damage these drugs do to society. There are plenty of websites out there, talktofrank is the worst by far.

  text: I'm amazed to find out that classification is still based on assumptions.<br /><br />It paralels in a way with inteligent design. People ignoring the evidence that is being clearly provided by people in the know and yet choosing to ignore it. <br /><br />In the case of reclasification, taxed drugs would work well for everyone as a source of revenue for govornment services.  Take example of plenty of European countries who have a more relaxed spin. I don't see the end of the world there.

  text: Reclassification is a waste of time. How harmful a drug isn't a simple matter that can be put in a league table. Small amounts of alcohol are beneficial, large quantities are harmful. How can that fit into a league table? What's the point?<br /><br />The public are generally aware of the risks drugs pose, and the majority of those who take them do so knowing that they are taking a risk. We should abandon this futile American led war on drugs and start legalising, regulating and taxing them all.

We've had a relationship with these drugs for hundreds of years, but only criminalised them in the last 30-odd.  Our prisons are full, our crime rates are sky-high.  Enough - make all classes of drugs legal but levy heavy taxation burdens on opiates and the like.  Unfortunately a lot of lawyers will have to find other jobs if a class of people are no longer defined as criminal.

This doesn't mean going soft, but to be realistic. Stress responsible use of drugs and the potential consequences they pose.

The (popular) press seems unable to cope with the science being anything other than black and white but many issues are fundamentally about shades of grey. Personally I would like to see science stay away from this issue as it is nothing but a political football.
