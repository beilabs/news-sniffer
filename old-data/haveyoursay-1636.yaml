    text: "If some poeple believe that Iran is developing nuclear energy for peaceful
      purposes, they are dreaming. Iran would otherwise be cooperating with the U.N
      instead of making threats and meaningless displays of military posturing. As for
      those with anti-U.S sentiments out there, you people really ought to reconsider
      your anti-american attitudes. One day when you will need the U.S to bail you out

      resolution at the United Nations Security Council calling on Iran to suspend

      program threatened the UK, and not Israel.  I guess because it's Israel's
      existence (and once again Jewish lives) at stake, everyone can sink into
      ideological excuses.  <br /><br />Ahmadinejad, like Hitler, repeatedly makes his
      intentions clear.  But it's been 60 years since the Holocaust and Europe is
      thirsting for another slaughter of Jews.  I guess European talk about human

      interests. US is ok w/Israel having nukes b/c they are our allies-Iran isn't.
      Iran is a threat to the US because they have a radical gov't that isn't aligned
      w/our interests. No reason to believe that if Iran had nukes it would not be
      used or given to others to use to harm the US or its allies. Not sure
      preventable.  However I support my gov'ts efforts to continue to try."

    text: "Iran is different from the other nations with nuclear weapons because they have
      nothing to lose.  In fact, they would have the most to gain from the drastic
      shake-up in the world's power structure a nuclear war would cause.  The US, UK,
      China, etc., on the other hand, have too much to lose to risk nuclear war.  It
      is in their best interests that a nuclear missile is never again launched.  This
      fact is why the world should fear a nuclear-armed Iran."

    text: "Quote from BBC News:'Iran's highest security body, the Supreme Council for
      National Security, has ordered the media not to discuss the issue. Newspapers
      are allowed to support the government line but not to oppose it.' Yet all the
      cretinous America/West haters ignore this and the fact that the UN, IAEA and the
      internatioanl community have united to stop the extremeist Iranian president and
      still blame the US/UK/Israel! Regime change in Iran is the only way to solve
      this problem!"

    text: "The West is often, fairly enough, accused of double standards regarding nuclear
      technology. However, there are massive differences between the situations. Iran
      is directly threatening Israel and the thought of them providing the technolgy
      to other unstable nations and terrorists is incredibly frightening. With the
      upturn in rhetoric - can we believe it is for peaceful purposes."
