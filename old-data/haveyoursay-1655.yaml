      trust the media than their own government according to a poll for a major
      conference this week.<br /><br />On average 61% said they trusted the media,
      compared to 52% who believed their government's explanations.<br /><br />This
      week, the BBC, Reuters and US think tank The Media Center are hosting a major
      conference exploring the impact of technology and the internet on the media and
      on society.<br /><br /><b>Who do you turn to for information? Are you a blogger
      or do you read them? Has the digital revolution had any effect on you or do you
      feel left behind? Do you put more trust in the government or the media?</b>"

    text: Least of all the BBC with its proclivity to dress opinion up as fact and compassion looks as a substitute for subjectivity. Most all media is guilty of letting down its guard against personal and institutional bias. When that happens the media outlook as well as the message looses credibilty.

Those of you insulting the BBC I suggest you look at Fox for "unbiased" reporting.

Sadly the standards of journalism within the news media from both the BBC and commericlal organisations have been reduced greatly over the last few years. I feel the news of late has been become too emotional and washy. This is especially true in the case of the BBC breakfast news which has become a joke even though some of the news items are quite serious. I want to see a return of some proper news jorunalism.
