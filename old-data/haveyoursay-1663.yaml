Why is it that we muslims in London can march against Iraq but when it comes to our black brothers and sisters in Darfur we say and do nothing. It is time for us to put pressure on the muslim governments of africa to put an end to the killing. But perhaps the muslims being murdered in Darfur are the wrong race of muslims...

      the rebels. It was the rebels who struck first. When you talk about the
      genocide, don't forget it's also a civil war and the rebels are responsible too.
      If China does business with Sudan for oil, whoever supports the Rebels is after
      oil too. Since there is little discussion in western media about those rebels, I
      can only guess they either have no interest in an objective opinion or have too
      many secrets to save."

      three asks. Send NATO in to create a no-fly zone in Darfur. Give 163 million
      dollars to the AU troops in 2006. Give 700 million dollars to the AU troops in
      2007. Additionally, the 50,000 people at the rally hoped to draw international

      in Darfur but not in Iraq?\" so I'd like to answer that. The war in Iraq has
      only made matters worse in that country. Saddam's genocide had ended about a
      decade BEFORE the US invasion, and his country was stable. Since the invasion,
      however, Iraq has just been non-stop violence, and the feuding between the
      different sects is certainly beginning to look like a genocide in the making."

Time and time again the government has dithered and one wonders whether there is a serious commitment to get the displaced people back or whether there are sinister motives playing an invisible hand. Deadlines have come and gone; peace being an aberration with death being the only certainty. The future of Dafur is extremely stark. The African Union needs to get its act together.

      protested against the US invading a country which had not attacked us, nor was a
      direct threat to us. I don't remember Sudan ever having attacked us? The BBC

    text: ship in guns to the vulnerable villages and give them away  . do not send troops. Within a year rescuers become occupiers in the minds of the locals  and are hated while those who give you guns are  loved forever. Remember the parable that if you give a person a fish you feed them for a day but if you teach them  to  fish for themselves ..... Power comes from the barrel of a gun.  and God blessed the child whose got his own.
