    text: "Whilst history will no doubt judge Tony Blair as one of the great reformers of
      the Labour Party, he should see now that his days are in power are drawing to an
      end, and bow out gracefully. <br /><br />Margaret Thatcher made the mistake of
      hanging on too long and was ousted from Downing Street in an undignified
      manner.<br /><br />Blair should learn from recent history and not make the same
      mistake"

      the most deceitful governments of all time. He is a charlatan and a liar. In
      times past, Prime Ministers had money of their own. This one - in partnership
      with his wife - seems hell bent on making some for himself. How on earth can any
      one legitimately service a mortgage the size of theirs? As for Iraq, words fail
      me. He and his government are guilty of the mass murder of our troops - for 
      absolutely nothing!"

Do we want the next year to be all about when the PM will pass the torch or do we want the next year to be about fixing the problems with our public services. Yes Tony Blair must hand over power but I would rather he made an attempt to fix things in this country than name a date for his departure.

      self preservation for Labour marginals on the taxpayers gravy train"

He is still a very successful Prime Minister and as such he has earned the right to decide when he should go. Compared to previous hand overs of power (i.e Thatcher to Major) this will be the most ordered and painless of any recent goverment when he does decide to go. Tony should take his time and not rush important decisions such as these.

    text: Mr Blair lost credibility when he aligned himself with Mr Bush in his adventurism. He then became a lame duck when he announced his planned departure. He should not give notice of departure. He should either resign and let the Party choose a new leader and successor or go to the country with a new slate for a new mandate if he wants to continue.

Blair should have gone long ago because his foreign policy amounts to state terrorism and he is guilty of war crimes. If our taxes were not being spent on his counterproductive "war on terror" which really is a war of terror there might be more public money available for running this country better.

More serious for his Party was to impy publicly that he would hand over power to someone else before the next election. Blair should resign immediately and Labour should elect a new leader. This is the only way they can fight the next election with any credibility.

This shows the normal reaction of the bunch of total failures at the top of this once proud Party that are now in power. Blair must go and go now. His policies must be radically changed to really get back to why Labour was created and that was not to reinforce Thatcherism.

    text: "In 1997 there was a lot of tactical voting to get rid of the Tories - it was ABC
      (anyone but Conservative) voting. In 2001 that stood firm. In 2005 we saw that
      tactical vote start to unwind. Last week we saw it totally unwind and now it is
      becoming ABL (anyone but Labour). People are beginning to understand the lies
      about the economy which is actually in a very poor state and will take 10-15
      years to put right. Together with the sleaze and Blair/Brown are now finished.
      Good riddance."

He will have to be pushed out.<br />The good news is the longer he hangs on and stays in power the more damage he will do to the labour / con artist party.This means it increase the chances even further of a massive tory revival or an extreme right wing back lash.<br />You are doing a great job there Tony keep going your ego and drive for immortality and will ensure your downfall.

      before we got to polls again. Also, Gordan Brown shold not be handed the reigns
      (it is not democratic, the public and party his haven't elected him), it should

If Mr Blair hangs on there may well be a contest for the next leader of the Labour party which will give us a choice of prime minister.

He is a victim of the media which has done much to highlight the problems of him and his policies and chosen to ignore his achievements. I do not believe that one man who has done so much for his party and country should bow to pressure and step down. We owe this man a lot. Let him step down on his terms and with dignity.

And now he declares he will give ample time for his "successor" to adjust to the throne before leaving when HE thinks suitable. And all we "electorate" and media ponder on is to speculate what he could have meant by "ample time"! In REAL democracy a referendum would have been called resulting in new elections and a new party with a more able leader would have been in charge.

      really angry when I think of the opportunity that Labour have wasted under the

    text: "Some say that the people had their say last year. Two problems with that:
      firstly, there was no option to vote for a Labour Party that wasn't led by Blair
      and secondly, because of the need to redraw constituency boundaries, the
      Conservatives managed to win the popular vote in England without winning the
      seats. We need the public to have more say over party leadership and we need
      constituency boundaries redrawn before every election."

      memory serves me right, Scotland has devolved powers. Similarly Reid at the Home
      Office (a generally devolved post) and Darling (Transport); the latter spending
      millions on Scottish Railways whilst England's branchlines face the axe. No
      Scots representing Scottish constituencies should be permitted to hold offices
      that effect England."
