    text: When I was 6 years old my sister rushed into my bedroom saying she had just seen a UFO. Like a flash I was off and jumped from the top of the stairs right down to the bottom. My dad still told me off for pulling off such a dramatic jump but only after I had come too after the operation for the shattered leg bone. A few weeks later my sister nearly put me back in hospital by putting a toy devil on my bed just in the right position for it to be the first thing I saw on waking.

    text: While I was working for a large telecommuncations company near Brighton I happened to glance out of the window one day and noticed a silver cigar shaped object hovering about 800m up in sky. It must have been at cloud level as it kept disapearing into the cloud.I was on a client call at the time so I couldnt tell anybody but just stared in disbelief. The object turned then disappered for a final time behind some clouds.  One of my friends told me he had seen the same thing a few days later.

      the speed of light can't be surpassed, so it's not a feasible method of
      transport, but whose to say that the observations of UFO's aren't mental
      manifestations, where alien lifeforms travel psychokinetically, into our
      collective consciousness? That seems to me much more feasible. The science of
      the mind is just as advanced if not tremendously more than that of the physical
      world as we know."

      And it's actually quite often that one sees things in the sky one can't
      immediately positively identify. There are LOTS of reasons why it might be
      impossible to identify UFOs. But I see precious little reason to assume that any
      of the objects and occurrences we label UFOs are owned and operated by little

      project onto the small portion of our consensual reality we percieve to be
      unknown......aliens . If you take psychotropic drugs, parts of the psyche alien

      of their national news early 2006, yet, i've not seen or heard one report on

      the ordinary phenomenon does or does not exist.  Most of the universe is unknown
      to us.  I find it demeaning to read such a statement, though I live outside the
      UK.  The scope of the unknown is outside the jurisdiction of a bureau or
      committee.  Why make a statement at all, or leave investigation up to
      government?"

    text: I find it odd that a report that is suposed to be top secret is realised because of the feedom of information act this would NOT happen. That makes me suspicious of why it was realised. Also people saying it is impossible to travel faster than light it is not that long ago we thought it was immpossible to travel faster than sound. You cannot say for certain what is immpossible based on what currant theorys are as theorys change when we learn new things.

      have multiplied, as have the reports. This could be explained either by humans
      seeing what they want to see, or by real alien visits. In my view aliens exist,
