    text: At the end of the day it is the ladies choice I think she is old enough to make up her own mind. Being older and probably better off is a much better way to bring up a child. The child will also have a brother or sister around. The parents might end up living a long happy life. Some people seem to think that when you are old that is the end.

    text: "It's hard to figure why someone that age and with grown children would want a
      baby. I think if she's healthy and has the energy and it makes her happy then
      it's her business. She's going to feel out of place, though, when she's in her
      late 70's with teenagers. That's a real downside of this situation. I thought I
      was \"late\" having a baby at 33 and now I'm 54. I don't think I would want to
      have a baby at my age. I'm looking ahead and forward to \"grandmother days.\"
      Good luck to her!!"

      admire her determination and independent spirit. As for the practicalities of
      looking after a child when the parent is \"older than average\" well it may not
      be the norm, but I'm sure there are plenty of examples of grandparents bringing
      up their grandchildren, and doing a great job, so it's hardly a unique
      situation. The most important thing is every child should feel wanted, cared for
      and loved, and this child surely well be."

      Obviously older parents have these children with every intention to look after

      than many young and sometimes selfish parents do. A child born to loving older
      parents who will nurture and help create the child's personality  will be better
      off than a child born to parents that are too young, not ready, and who have a
      unstable relationship. A child's personality is created in the first 7 years.
      What right does anyone have to pass judgement, criticise or condemn older

      has children, I think is being totally selfish, especially with a whole number
      of young couples that want children and can’t have them! What quality of life
      will this child have, how will the child feel being in their teens with parents
      in their 80’s? At this age in many cases the job of being carer becomes a role
      reversal; the children start to care for their elderly parents! I really don’t
      agree with their decision."

Life is precious and should not be denied.  Even at 63.. love and compassion is a gift and should be allowed to flourish. God Bless the Children.. for they are our hope and pray that they can live to see our world grow into a safe place where all are treated equally.

      for a reason. If we are allowed to continue bearing children ad infinitum, when

      Mrs Farrant went to Italy for her treatment, I am against fertility treatment
      too - especially on the NHS.  There is, sadly, an abundance of orphaned children
      that are crying out for a good home - if people are really serious about wanting
      a child and can't have one naturally, why don't more consider adoption before
      demanding their 'rights' to free fertility treatment?"

    text: "Having children in your sixties is just wrong.<br />Not only are there many
      health risks, but i feel the main issue here is the child. The child may have no
      parents by the time they are 18 years old-they will constantly be worrying about
      their parents dying. The relationship between the child and the parent wil no be
      the same as any other child and parent relationship. Having children at 60 is
      selfish to the child!!!"

If a 60  year old can get pregnant naturally (as a man can have a child well in to old age) then fair enough. This however is just a someone making the decision that what they want is more important than what nature intended. I am not agaisnt IVF but believe it should be restricted to the the pre-menipausal.
