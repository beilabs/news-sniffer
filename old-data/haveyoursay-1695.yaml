      /><br />The US has defended its treatment of suspects detained in its “war on
      terror”, telling a UN committee in Geneva that it considers the use of torture
      as wrong.<br /><br />Human rights groups have accused the government of allowing
      the torture and inhumane treatment of foreign terror suspects at their detention
      centres in Afghanistan, Iraq, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. <br /><br /><b> Will
      UN Committee hearing make a difference? Send us your comments.  </b>"

    text: "\"What is the position ......on the situation at Guantanamo and CAN they
      .......demand its closure or kick the Americans out?\"  Michael James, United
      Kingdom <br /><br />Michael, Cuba's position is pretty simple.  An american
      government invaded Cuba on a pretext of being attacked, 'liberated' the place
      rather like Iraq has been liberated, and appointed a patsy president, who was
      coerced to sign Guantanamo Bay over to the US as a refueling staion.  The
      disputed (hotly and for many years) territory is defended against Cuban attack
      by the largest minefield in the western hemisphere, check this on google some
      time."

      />Guantanamo is the result of an open ended lease agreement with Cuba from 1903.
      Part of the lease  says \"The United States shall exercise complete jurisdiction
      and control over said area (approximately 17 miles).  It is therefore not
      sovereign US territory and per a 1950 supreme court ruling, foreign nationals
      outside of our sovereign territory are NOT intitled to the same constitutional
      rights.  Does Castro like it?...No.  Will he respond?....He can sure try!....Are
      we going anywhere?...hell no.  End of story."

    text: I had an avengelist friend who turned away from his Church and he told me that the reason why Bush is liked in the conservative camp is because he is preparing for the greater plan for the second coming of Messiah. I thought he was joking but the more I think about it the more it makes sense. This administration does have an underhand religious axis to it.

      big mistake keeping prisoners and torturing them with readings from Harry
      Potter. If they'd broadcast some beheadings from Gitmo, I'm sure the brave
      freedom fighters will kidnap some US soldiers (never civilians, never women) and
      in retaliation they'll put panties on their heads and post the pics on internet,
      humiliating them to death. We'll comment afterwards on BBC about the equivalence
      of the 2 atrocities."

      It's about time US simply dismantled the whole UN building in NY and make some
      good use of the real estate.  Donald Trunp would love to have his partments
      there.  France, Germany and Russia did not want to address Iraq because of their
      economic interests.  China and Russia do not want to take care of Iran for the
      same reason. This whole thing is a farce."

      />That’s certainly the way to jump back to a morally reprehensible world with
      kangaroo courts and vigilantism. You forget the majority of these people have
      not been charged with anything, and some, if not many have been picked up in
      \"error\".  You also forget that the US signed a treaty against using torture. 
      Treaties and laws are made to reign in our savage impulses and deter
      irresponsible and reprehensible action, and yet you are suggesting we give in to
      our baser instincts because of a climate of fear. Hope I never meet you on a

      around the world, torture is something that Americans would never even dream of
      doing. As an immigrant (my family came to the US from India in 1988, when I was
      about 3), I feel almost betrayed that my adopted country would do such things.
      What is worse, though, is that they continually deny employing this barbaric
      practice. I would still be strongly opposed to torture, but I (and the rest of
      the world) would think better of our government if they would at least
      acknowledge the abuses."
