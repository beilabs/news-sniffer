      BNP picked up a few seats, mostly in one area; interesting to see if their views
      on will get the pavements mended quicker. The LibDems went nowhere, No change
      there then. And if this is the best Cameron can do in these circumstances then
      he's got no hope in the future."

So the Tory gains were seen as a victory for David Cameron. This means that any protestations of belief in local government by any national politician are a sham.  No wonder the turnout was low.

      being spent on public services and the results of this were abundantly clear.
      However, in the latest election the Conservatives gained the council from no

      of Tony Blair and New Labour.  My voting for Lib Dem was not because of the last
      two weeks of headlines. It started with the IRAQ WAR, Foundation hospitals,
      tuition fees, Tessa Jowell, talking about Iran's nuclear power which implied the
      potential war and invasion of Iran, seeing Condoleeza Rice with Jack Straw, the
      double standards, hypocricy and arrogance of new labour."
