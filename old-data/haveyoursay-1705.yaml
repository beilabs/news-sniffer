      them? Why do lawyers still try to keep defendants out of prison at all costs?
      Presumably the assaults, rapes and bullying that take place there are just
      \"high spirits\"? No matter how tough they are, our prisons do not reform anyone
      and only have minimal deterent value - as does threat of execution in other
      countries. If we want to reduce crime we have to take a long hard look at the

    text: The Goverment has tried and failed on numerous occasions to combat this problem.Instead of letting these offenders out with tags on like animals to wander the street again without proper supervision do them the courtesy of<br />allowing them serve their sentence fully.<br />On release they then sign a declaration not to re-offend.If they do then they have to serve the sentence all over again.You have to be cruel to be kind.Repeat offenders need repeat sentences.
