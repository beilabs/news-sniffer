    text: "A bill which would enable doctors to prescribe lethal doses of drugs to
      consenting terminally ill people will be debated in the Lords on Friday.<br
      /><br />Lord Joffe has proposed that although a doctor would not be able to
      directly administer lethal doses of drugs his bill would give an end of life
      ‘option’. <br /><br /><b>What do you think about assisted suicide for
      terminally ill people? Do you agree with it? Will it lead to euthanasia? Should
      we have the right to take our own life?</b>"

      shortenned the lives of some of my terminally ill patients - and held their
      hands while they have died. But I never have, and sincerely hope I never will be
      expected to do so purely to end life - the earlier end to life was an

      to relieve suffering, not to clear away those who society find embarrassing,

    text: I am in total agreement with the bill before the house on assisted suicides.I lived in Holland where it is legal and takes two authorising doctors.Therefore with checks like this in place then I see no reason if someone who is terminally ill to seek an end to their pain and long drawn out demise. I have witnessed it fist hand with the death of my partner in Holland and it does give dignity to the person. Respect and freedom of choice not religion and closed minds..

    text: I’ve worked in hospitals with elderly folk who genuinely feel they are ‘troubling’ us by being a patient. It’s chilling to think that 1/3 people requesting PAS in Oregon feel they are a ‘burden’. As Baroness Finlay said ‘a sense of duty to die is all too easy to create and all too difficult to detect’. Any civilised society should not dream of putting such pressure on our elderly population. No wonder most geriatricians and palliative care workers are against this bill.

      hippocratic oath and religious belief. A thorough debate is needed."

We are not at liberty to do what we want.   Laws offer protection for the safety and good of society. Life has always been seen as a good. The motives of a person intervening to stop a suicide off a bridge or of rescue workers digging for bodies after an earthquake are human and basic and quite at odds with the thrust of the Joffe Bill.

    text: Most terminal illness involves being in a lot of pain. To control the pain drugs are used. The drugs kill the person eventually as the affect the respiratory system. The greater the pain level the more drugs are used and the nearer death comes. Thus euthanasia exists to a degree already. The logical progression of arguing against euthanasia is to deny the pain killing drugs that actually speed up the dying process.

    text: I believe that if a person is in a point of no return (medically) he should be allowed to bow out (euthanasia). See if miracles are bound to happen they will happen even in cases of euthanasia. But you should allow a person to die if he has reached a point of no return. His relatives or closest friends should be given the authority in case the patient is not in a position to confirm (in coma)when the status has been confirmed medically.

Will people in this position in a few years down the line be put under pressure or become obliged to ask to die to save money and sensibilities of family and the state and NHS if such a law is passed.  Such rights can became obligations in an authoritarian state or where perceived public morality changes making what was a choice compulsory. The law as it stands protects the disabled sick and infirm from this.

Once "assisted suicide" is legal sick people will come under pressure from greedy relatations to do the decent thing and "pop off" before the savings have been used up or the house sold. Also there will be continuous pressure to move the boundaries of the law as more "hard cases" emerge that teeter on the edge of the law and prevent people who would like to die by assisted suicide from doing so legally.

    text: I am only in my twenties but i have seen how life threatening diseases can make a person suffer.  I know that i would not like to die like that.  If i had the option i would chose to go with dignity and end my life assisted.  Why live the last few years of yor life in constant pain.  I believe that the bill is a good move.  If people want to die then having it legally assisted should be their option.

The slim chance I could survive longer would be reason to give me what could end up being be a false hope. I would end up less well prepared to die. We should not be putting more pressure on doctors to make very difficult judgements in very difficult circumstances.

      the moment we can treat our pets better than our parents !  If your pet was
      terminal, in distress and pain you can (and indeed would be expected to if you
      were a good owner) put it out of it's misery. However OTHER people's religious
      beliefs could override your sick parent's wishes and you would simply have to

    text: This issue has come at a point in time when the faith of the world is being tested with respect to humanright which of course is inalienable. i am of the strong conviction that before this is done since the the patient is terminally ill and his sense of judgement may be a bit impaired it would be proper for the consent of the patients family should be sought first. though religiously it might not be appropriate,it will go a long way to reduce suffering of terminally ill patients.
