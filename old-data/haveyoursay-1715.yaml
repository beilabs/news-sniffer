      also advocates global islamic rule. I think, more than anything, Ahmadinejad is

      towards anybody. This letter must be taken with a grain of salt especially
      considering President Ahmadinejad's inflmatory comments against all Jews.
      Although this letter sounds good, based on past experience with middle eastern

      distraction from the Nuclear discussion"

      USA and USSR have been involved in many armed conflicts and cannot reasonably be
      considered any less likely to start a conflict than Iran (based on conflicts
      fought in since 1979). Perhaps the proliferation of nuclear weapons will make

Membership of the Nuclear family under the IAEA is voluntary. So the offer by Aminajad is being watched by Russia and China and possibly France too. A refusal to penalise Iran will tie Americas hands and it will then not be able to act militarily of its own accord.

    text: Nothing will happen on ground. All the action will happen only in the media. Look at North Korea crisis. People fear to attack strong countries like North Korea and Iran. If West attacks Iran it can possiblly lead to unification Arab countries and a World war III. West do not have a strong case aginest IRAN for anykind of action. Everthing is based on imaginary speculation with out any intilligence.

Under strct guidlines or America supplying Iran with enriched uranium for thier power and officials from other countries making sure that all uranium is accounted for and spent fuel rods are disposed of by the USA i think that they should be allowed to use nuclear power. After all america used the first nuke so who are they to critisize other countries.

    text: "AhmadiNejad's letter to Bush will not be discussed in public by U.S. officials.
      Sec. Rice dismissed it as \"philosophical\" and said it offered nothing new. It
      touched on Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Venezuela &#38; Africa. Iran said U.S.
      policies destroy lives of ordinary people who want peace without interference.
      Asks this is democracy &#38; Christianity? To join with him in a neo-religio
      order. Letter seems a vehicle for domestic consumption and other Islamic
      sectors. May peace prevail."

    text: I believe the “West” and the Bush administration in particular must use this window of opportunity the Iranian President has opened and must initiate meaningful diplomatic and political dialogue with the Iranian people and their government. The rush to war another war in the Gulf must be resisted.

    text: Unless the letter was abusive or threatining it should be replied to as common courtesy demands. If the might of America cannot or will not muster the wit to respond to the pen it suggests she is only interested in the might of the sword.<br />Deplomacy may just begin begin by sabre rattling and once again it is the middle east that has stolen the initiative.
