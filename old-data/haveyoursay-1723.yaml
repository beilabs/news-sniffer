    text: "<b>Do parents with learning difficulties receive sufficient support?</b><br
      /><br />Almost half of parents with learning difficulties have their children
      taken into care, according to a report published by Bristol University.<br /><br
      />It argues that families could stay together if they were given better support,
      and possibly parenting classes.<br /><br /><b>Do you agree with the report's
      authors? Have you had experience of this situation? What do you think of the
      idea of parenting classes? Send us your comments.</b>"

      you can't look after children without \"support\" is a good reason not to have
      them. Intelligence is partly inherited. We don't have the resources to provide

      mother-to-be, I'd jump at the opportunity to pick up some tips.<br /><br />Back
      to the debate - yes, parents with learning difficulties should be supported - if
      they need (or want) support. If not, why interfere? The same applies to all
      parents. It's possible to be extremely functional in every other area of life
      and yet still need help with raising kids."

    text: This is a disgrace brought on by our Government. They set targets for number of adoptions to take place in a year and I cannot believe that people who are less able at school are having their children taken from them. It does not say that they are bad parents or even stupid. Just in an academic environment some find it hard. How does this make you a bad parent. Social Services has a lot to answer for. They have done some awful things in the past and have too much Power.

      the massive hole in pensions they've created by taxing pension funds. The effect
      of this is that only irresponsible people who work the system to gain more
      benefits will have large numbers of children. These are the very people who
      abdicate responsibility for their own kids, and rely on the state to bring them
      up. Hard-working people often cannot afford kids because of high taxes, property
