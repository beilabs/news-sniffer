    text: "<b>What limits should there be on storing embryos?</b> <br /> <br />A couple
      hoping for another child are looking for a foreign clinic to look after the
      embryos – because they have reached the five-year legal limit for storage in
      the UK.<br /><br />Martin Hymers and Michelle Hickman from Greater Manchester
      are applying to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to transfer the
      embryos. Ms Hickman lost her uterus during birth complications.<br /><br
      /><b>Who should decide how long embryos are stored? What time limits should
      there be on storage? What issues are raised by by improvements in fertility
      technology? What are your experiences?</b>"

      prospective parent to raise the child. Once the parent dies, or is unable to
      raise a child, the embryos should be destroyed. A five year limit seems
      arbitrary. It might as well be 6.7 years, or 25.4 years, or 100 years. Little or
      no thought has gone into it. If the embryo can be stored longer, and the
      prospective parent can afford it, I see no reason why time alone should destroy
      prospective life."

    text: "Embryos should be stored, free of charge, for a reasonable time e.g. 5 years.
      After that, any couple wishing to have frozen embryos stored for longer should
      have to pay for the service.  Also I think any couple wishing to have embryos
      frozen should have to sign some kind of legal document, acknowledging their
      requirements for the embryos in the event their circumstances change e.g.
      relationship breakdown. By doing this we could reduce court cases on such
      matters and further emotional trauma."

    text: "There has to be some limit otherwise you might have children born (to surrogate
      mothers) long after their parents and families were dead. That would be
      ridiculous. However, rather than a blanket 5 or 10 year limit let's have more
      sensible system. For example, destroy embryos when the mother reaches the
      typical maximum age for natural conception, say 50 for example.<br />Ed

    text: "There is a reason for this rule and that is that the effects of freezing are
      damaging to embryos. <br />You are considered lucky if you get 50% of frozen
      embryos back alive after short freezing, let alone beyond a 5 year limit.<br
      />The chances are that this couple are fighting over embryos that would never
      survive thawing.<br />Also, to clarify, an embryo is not a baby. Its an embryo."
