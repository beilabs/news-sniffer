    text: "<b>What do you think of the proposal to introduce road pricing?</b><br /><br
      />Douglas Alexander, the new Transport Secretary will announce a £10m fund to
      develop a nationwide road charging scheme. The proposed scheme will charge
      drivers by the mile.<br /><br />Road pricing is one of several measures that has
      been looked at to tackle congestion.  Bristol, Bath, Cambridge and the West
      Midlands are just some of the authorities developing road charging proposals.<br
      /><br /><b>Would you be prepared to pay? Do you think you these charges will
      help our congestion problem?  How do you think this will impact peoples lives? 
      What are your thoughts?</b>"

      road-charging.  If this foolish government insists on going ahead with this,
      then fair enough - but wipe out tax on fuel and Road Tax, otherwise I might as
      well just hand over my entire salary to the government, given that, with my
      30-mile journey to work, I have a choice between driving for about 50 minutes
      (on a good journey), or using public transport to cover the same distance in 2
      hours.  Or, I could get myself fired and start claiming benefits instead - now
      there's an idea!"

      pay by the minute too! Seems to me that another tax equals inflation.  When you
      get down to it, we rely too much on transport.  I know people who zip down to
      London for the day for meetings and zip home again.  Frankly, any daily journey
      over 5 miles is unnatural!  I'm as bad as most: I commute 25 miles each way yet
      90% of my work could be done in a quarter of the time from home over broadband
      and a phone.  Unfortunately, i have to be seen to be in the office or people get

      road tax to compensate. However a simple per mile rate will benefit gas guzzlers
      and hit those who have tried to help by buying high milage vehicles. If this is
      too work there must not only be variables rates for the time of day, but for the

    text: I think that in general fuel tax is the best way of taxing road use since it has the dual effect of encouraging more fuel efficient vehicles. <br /><br />However I think that road pricing does have a place in specific locations where there is a congestion problem; such as in certain cities. In these situations the money raised should be spent on improving the local public transport network of that city in order to give people a better alternative.

      at £1/litre that's £4.54/gallon. The tax is about 80%, which is therefore
      about £3.50 per gallon.  If you do 35mpg then £3.50 divided by 35mpg equals
      10p/mile.  <br /><br />Does that help you with your maths ?"
