    text: "<b>Should the genetic screening of embryos be extended to cover a wider range of
      diseases?</b><br /><br />The UK fertility watchdog is to decide on whether a
      wider range of diseases, including breast cancer, can be covered by genetic
      screening.<br /><br />This means that couples with a family history of a
      particular disease could be screened for it.<br /><br /><b>Would you choose to
      screen for inherited diseases? Should doctors be focussing on prevention rather
      than cure? Is this a type of pre-natal selection? Send us your comments.</b>"

      having (say the breast cancer gene BCR1) doesn't mean you'll automatically get

    text: Screening should be available to those who ask and the choice should be theirs. Evolutionary pressures would kill many of the people that we can keep alive today so it is nonsense to say that we would be eradicating a class of people by our will alone. Additionaly there are many people who will bring disabled or genetically damaged children into the world by choice. Getting all steamed up over the deep moral implications is unecessary.

I am generally in favour of the good the technology could do but we must not rush things.

    text: I think we should do embryonic testing. If we eradicate inherited diseases then so be it. It could be used by known carriers of inherited genetic anomalies and if we could find a way to rectify then that is a good thing. If testing is used by other institutions for finding out health risks then that should be illegal.<br />It would be wonderful if we could remove all inherited diseases through genetic manipulation. It is a whole new world and we should embrace it.

If proportion of women available for marriage reduces it will increase the value of women in society and make DOWRY history. No widow or divorced women would have to think of being a single parent.
