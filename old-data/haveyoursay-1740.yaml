    text: "<b>How are you following your team in the finals of the European and domestic
      tournaments?</b><br /><br />Middlesborough face Sevilla tonight in the final of
      the UEFA Cup in Eindhoven. Though they are underdogs, they have twice fought
      back from seemingly impossible scorelines to be there. <br /><br />And it's
      never seemed busier to be a fan of British football: the League play-offs begin
      tomorrow; the FA Cup and SFA Cup finals are on Saturday; and next week Arsenal
      will play Barcelona in the Champions League final.  <br /><br /><b>Are you a
      Middlesborough fan? Are you in Eindhoven for the match? How will you be
      watching?</b>"

      loser, Maclaren (even worse than that other loser, Robson - who's let down every
