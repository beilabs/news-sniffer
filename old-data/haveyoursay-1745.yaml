    text: "<b>Should the link between pensions and earnings be reinstated?</b><br /><br
      />Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have agreed on a deal which will restore the link
      between the state pension and earnings.<br /><br />The changes will not come
      into force until at least 2012 and would be paid for in part by raising the
      state pension age from 65 to 68 by 2050.<br /><br /><b>Are the proposals
      workable? Would you be happy to work beyond the current retirement age? Is this
      fairer than the current system? Are you worried about your pension? What are you
      doing to prepare for your retirement? If you are already retired do you feel
      that you have made the right decision?</b>"

      after their health from the start, something many of today’s young aren’t
