    text: "<b>Can learning about communities with diverse culture and traditions contribute
      to the sense of British identity?</b><br /><br />The government is setting up a
      review  into whether 'core British values'  should become a compulsory part of
      the curriculum for all 11 to 16 year-olds. <br /><br />At the same time,
      ministers are establishing a second review into the quality of teaching about
      Islam in universities.<br /><br />These two reviews arise from the government's
      desire to use education as a means of creating a more united and cohesive
      society in Britain in the aftermath of last July's London bombings. <br /><br
      /><b>What are your perceptions of British identity? Can a strong sense of
      British identity be nurtured through education? What can be done to improve the
      understanding of Islam in Western society? Send us your views.</b>"

      /><br />This is a goverment which has, above all other recent outrages,
      illegally invaded a soverign power and murdered both foreign nationals and
      British sevice men. If the Conservatives had any guts they would turn British
      politics on its head and create a manifesto and a goverment which had the best

I think that values would vary from area to area within the UK as there are some unique differences between the countries that make up the UK. <br />Probably the one core value that stands out to me is tolerance. As the countries that make up the UK are all different we have learned to be tollerant of others. I think the vast majority of people in the UK are more tolerant than most and that tolerance would be one of my British values.

    text: Nationalism is just a tool of the elite to manipulate the masses into believing in a false collective. There is no such thing as "Britain". Nationalism is designed to cut across classes and thereby destroy class conciousness. Thats why America uses it so much. Fortunatly we are not as bad.. but the establishment is trying to boost British nationalist feeling again.

    text: "Britain has become a nation of sentimental softies, lacking any grit and
      determination. Once a nation of skilled craftsmen and polished professionals it
      is now leaderless and drifting. Britain is the soft touch to whoever or whatever
      may want to take advantage of the extreme and pampered welfare state."

    text: "It is so typical of British people to complain about their country. I am
      Brazilian married to an English man and live in the UK. The people who I have
      encountered and made friends with are people of principals, hard-workers, fun,
      suportive, independents...  Nowhere is perfect, live abroad and check it out for
      yourself! I certainly didn't have the independecy that I have in England back in
      my country neither the same opportunities!"
