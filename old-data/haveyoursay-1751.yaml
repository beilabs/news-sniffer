    text: "<b>Should campaigners target company shareholders?</b><br /><br />An extremist
      animal rights group has sent threatening letters to shareholders in
      GlaxoSmithKline, threatening to publish their names on the internet, unless they
      sell their shares in the company.<br /><br />Currently, shareholders' names (for
      any PLC) are publicly available at Companies House, though shareholders can opt
      to have their shares held in an anonymous ('nominee' account).<br /><br />GSK
      have been targeted for their use of Huntingdon Life Sciences.<br /><br /><b>Are
      you a GSK shareholder? Have you had a letter from animal rights activists? What
      would you do if you did? Do campaign groups have the right to contact publicly
      listed shareholders?</b>"

    text: Shareholders should have the option of remaining anonymous if that is what is required to protect their security.  In the longer term though we must face down the extremists and stand up for science.  Pro-Test in Oxford have shown that if we all stand together the animal rights extremist threats will be shown to be as empty as the lies they peddle to further their cause.

      Do I agree with the animal rights protestors in principal? Possibly, although
      drugs testing is far more of a grey area than cosmetics testing. Regardless, the
      protestors should not be violent, they have the right to peaceful protest only.
      Two wrongs do not make a right, and they are only harming the cause."

    text: I would hope that any animal rights protester who seeks to target shareholders of GSK does not have any sort of equity related pension or tracker type ISA.<br />Since the vast majority of GSK shareholdings are held by pension funds (typically FTSE trackers) then I would imagine a good chunk of the country (animal rights people included) are GSK shareholders.

GSK can therefore rightfully claim that their activities confirm to MUCH tougher ethical standards than those governing your organic grocer or fair trade coffee shop. GSK have developed many life saving medicines. Their shareholders should be proud!
