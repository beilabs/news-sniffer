However in todays changing world planners and business men will turn to other parts of the UK as London prices outweigh the advantages.

      better than when I lived in London. The biggest problem is the infrastructure -
      especially  public transport  which is dire and getting worse. The problem of
      people buying second homes and weekend cottages is also increasing. This
      antisocial trend pushes up house prices and contributes nothing to village life.
      If people want to enjoy country life, they should move to the country -
      otherwise stay in town."

Thye South does cover a bit more than the capital city folks. Get an atlas and have a look. Not all the South is lovely and affluent and full of posh rich people.

    text: Britian is not divided by region or location anymore but by an age line somewhere near the 30 to 35. In basic terms those with houses and thouse without. If you dont have one even if you earn £40k or £50k buying one will be a massive financial burden for the next 25 yrs at current prices. This division will increase pension pressure as more youth look to emigrate as globalisation offers them better oppourtunities and a better standard of living.
