    text: "<b>What should be the Russian President's priorities?</b><br /><br />Vladimir
      Putin will deliver his 7th annual 'State Of The Nation' address on Wednesday.
      While the focus is usually on domestic issues, the country's international
      standing is also under scrutiny.<br /><br />At home, Putin can point to a
      fast-growing economy, helped by rising oil prices. But there's also severe
      poverty and burgeoning bureaucracy. Abroad, the country's dominant energy
      supplies attract attention, as well as Russia's role in dealing with Iran's
      nuclear ambitions.<br /><br /><b>What should President Putin make his main
      priority? What can he achieve in the next year of his Presidency? What is best
      for Russia and the world?</b><br /><br /><i>We'll put some of your questions to
      our Russia experts on BBC World and BBC News 24 at 1430 BST (1330 GMT) on
      Wednesday 10th May. Send us your questions below.</i>"

    text: The Russians are very Europeans. Putin should try to integrate more with the European family. Try to steer the traditional Russian vertical governing system into more democratic and at the end more efficient horizontal governing. Russia should take a long term goal to become a member of European Union. It would be good for both Russians and other Europeans and stabilize world peace. If Putin can make Russia friendly for the Europeans so the measure will be rewarded with equal friendliness.

      All I see is lip service from the UN and your “allies” around the world.
      Bottom line is that the US has only itself to rely on to prevent a new world

Maybe the money could also be put towards cleaning up Africa of the rusting Russian tanks and mines that were as much part of their past foreign policy as the threat of cutting energy supplies is today. My advice to the West...don´t get rid of one addiction (MEast) to another (Russia).
