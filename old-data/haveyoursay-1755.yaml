      /><br />BHS boss Philip Green has attacked David Cameron after the Tory leader
      accused him of selling a “creepy” line of children’s clothes.<br /><br
      />Mr Cameron mentioned the Little Miss Naughty underwear range as an example of
      the way sex was used to advertise and sell products aimed at children. But Mr
      Green said the line had been pulled from stores as inappropriate and that Mr
      Cameron should \"catch up with his reading\".<br /><br /><b>Are children being
      forced to grow up too quickly? What is appropriate? Who should be responsible
      for protecting children from commercial forces? Should it be up to parents or
      retailers? Is sex used to sell to children?</b>"

    text: My daughter started secondary school last September and the current fashion the girls at her school are following is to wear school skirts as short as they can get away with (or shorter). In my opinion it is inaproppriate for twelve year old girls to be displaying so much immodesty.

      have a childhood and not grow up so fast. when i was a young girl i would wear
      jeans and jumpers not mini skirts and make up. its dangerous and inappropriate
      given our society where paedophilia is rife. ultimately its up to a parent to
      say to their children 'no you're not having these clothes or make up' however
      shops should also help by not selling these items"

    text: Its true that childrens clothes are more like adult clothes and so could be seen as more sexy and sometimes more revealing.  I think this is because of an increase of adult celebrities as role models for children.   They are more keen to dress like people such as Britney Spears than people their own age.  This is also exacerbated by increasing fasion coverage in girls magazines.  Shops only stock clothes they know will be bought regardless of whether they are sexy or not.

      salesman who comes up with the idea has to convince parents to buy it. If no-one
      did, they'd soon stop producing them.<br />Children must be allowed to have a
      childhood, where dressing up in mummys clothes, shoes &#38; make-up is a game,
      not what you do before going to meet your friends."

      fashions of the latest pop or soap star it is up to parent of the child to not
      buy unsuitable clothes.  If it is not suitable for your child do not buy it. 
      Say no to your child - you are doing them a kindness in the long term as they
      have to learn that they cannot always have what they want.  Say no.  Don't buy
      it and the stores will stop selling such items.  It really is that easy!"

    text: "The same trend is flourishing in India as well. Parents, youth as well as the
      school going children are in the habit of following western cultures blindly.
      Exposing one’s body by wearing small skirts and dresses like that is a fashion
      these days. In a country like India, where there are lots of restrictions on
      sex, the impact of such a trend is terrible. It is poignant to see that when
      adopting lifestyles from another culture, people tend to choose the bad styles
      in most cases."

    text: "The frightening thing is how much control children have over parents and how
      little parents now exert over their children. The retailers only make such
      products because they know that it will sell - not because parents are happy to
      buy it, but because their children demand it. Isn't it time we stopped pandering
      to children's demands and actually instill in them an idea of what society
      expects from them - i.e. an understanding of social mores, manners and respect?"

      kids this sort of stuff do so because they actually like it, calling it sweet or
      cute. There are obviously a lot of them or the stores wouldn't be packed with
      those sort of clothes. Second, there are many who deny that female fashion is
      actually provocative and anyone who finds it so is a pervert."
