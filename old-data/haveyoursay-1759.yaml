      government right to appeal?</b><br /><br />The home secretary said it was
      important to challenge any ruling which may \"appear inexplicable or bizarre to
      the general public\". <br /><br />The Afghan men and their families have
      remained in the UK since hijacking a plane in Kabul and forcing it to land at
      Stansted airport in 2000. They claimed they were fleeing the Taliban regime.<br

      wall. These people have hijacked a plane and didn't get fined anything and can

      have started wondering as to why the BNP have gone from strength to strength.
      I've stopped wondering why..."

      commit an awfull criminal act and be considered to be a member of the British
      public, no matter where you are coming from. As a nation with liberal
      immigration laws all you need to do is ask and justify. So why commit such an
      act? I think there is more to this story than we have heard and if there isnt
      then the decison is simple ... deport!!"

    text: "the ruling is an absolute disgrace. this was not the reason the HRA was brought
      it. it was brought in (very basic definition) to protect innocent citizens from
      the state, not to stop the state from taking deportation action against criminal
      asylum seekers. the government are right (for once-stop the press)to appeal.
      raving bally mad-judiciary wake up before its too late and you add even more
      dangerous people to the streets of the uk who should by rights be either in
      prison or deported."

    text: "Although I admit this case is ridiculous, it is the comments I read here that
      make me ashamed to be British. Those seeking asylum are desperate and fear for
      their lives. Benefits are not that easy to get, and as a rich country and part
      of a global system that exploits the poor of this world we owe them much more.
      <br /><br />And as for the Human Rights Act - It if is this easy for you to
      dismiss, I assume you have never had yours seriously challenged. Oppression is
      NOT a word you understand."

    text: "Let the Judges do Their Job:<br />The government’s constant criticism of the
      judicial decisions, has worrying consequences for the independence of the
      judiciary, undermining their role in being the politically objective and neutral
      body of our constitution. This signals a breakdown in the foundational principle
      of all modern democratic constitutions that requires power to be dispersed and
      separated (pluralism). Judges should not be held to ransom by public opinion."
