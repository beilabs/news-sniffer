    text: "<b>Do you agree with the governments findings?</b><br /><br />The London
      bombings of 7 July could not have been prevented by security services, two
      reports are expected to conclude.  <br /><br />The government and a
      parliamentary committee have examined the attacks and it is thought they will
      say a lack of resources prevented ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan from being
      intercepted.  <br /><br />The security services are likely to be cleared of
      blame for the intelligence failure.<br /><br /><b>Do you agree with the

      Government agency will receive 100% of what it wants. They all have to work

      always find a way. But the bombing could have been prevented in the long-term;
      the bombers were young Muslim who felt totally alienated from the country of
      their birth, and felt greater allegiance to a religion that promises them death
      and glory. Some Muslims simply villify \"infidels\" and glorify suicide bombers,
      and the UK and other governments must learn to address this."
