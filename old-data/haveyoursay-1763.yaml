    text: The sharp increase in violence in the past few days speaks volumes about the attitude of the LTTE towards the ceasefire. They want to push the Sri Lankan government to an outright war. The Norwegian peace monitors are incapable of containing the situation.<br />I think it is high time the Indian government intervened to defuse the crisis. Pressure must be applied on Colombo to stop the gross human rights violations by the army. The LTTE must also come to the negotiating table.

    text: Sri Lanka has been in a civil war since 1983 and these talks are likely to be as unfruitful as the others. The problem has become virtually intractable and its difficult to see a solution. The Tamils wish for a return to the priviliged position they held under British rule while the Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists refuse to consider a federal solution or one that gives greater autonomy to the Tamils

    text: LTTE is not representing all Tamils of Sri Lanka. LTTE is a terrorist movement and has now evolved to be a moneymaking machine and will never want any peace to prevail. Its headed by a terrorist whose family for generations have been criminals and smugglers and he is an illiterate. Majority of the Tamil population is peace loving and moderate people. LTTE should be eliminated if peace is to prevail in Sri Lanka.

      Having seen enough of the LTTE's intransigence and its callous disregard for the

      that have banned the LTTE like the UK must go further in strictly enforcing the
