    text: "<b>What consequences will the lecturers' pay dispute have for students?</b><br
      /><br />Lecturers at Northumbria University have voted to go on strike
      indefinitely, as they refuse to mark exams and coursework. <br /><br
      />Examinations at several British universities have been cancelled or postponed
      because of the dispute and there is a concern among some students that they will
      not be able to graduate. <br /><br /><b>Are you caught up in the dispute? Are
      you a lecturer on strike, or a student whose exams have been suspended? What
      will the consequences be for the students? Send us your experiences and views.

      support students and do not feel comfortable when we have to take action).
      Secondly, we are not well paid for the work we do. It wasn't so long ago that
      one of my tutees started a graduate job that paid more than my salary, and this
      was after I had completed 7 years additional study and work after I graduated."

      the intransigence of employers in not being willing to negotiate that has led us
      to this situation. They've had FOUR MONTHS to negotiate but have left it to this

      On 1st of June the lecturers 12 week protection by their union is up, if they

Looking at job adverts for lecturers at my uni wages are between 25k and 40k. 12% on top of this is more than enough.<br /><br />What makes it worse is that Lancaster University Student Union are still supporting the boycott despite the NUS saying it should stop. So much for looking out for the students best interests!

    text: I am currently studying my degree part time at a network of hope.  Reading the articles on the BBC news site is the only way we are finding out what is going on.  Alls we know is that our exams will be going ahead. The lecturers have no arguments for causing disruptions to exams at the end of the year. If they actually cared about the job they are doing they would not be striking now. Its blatantly they are just greedy.  Any lectures causing people disruption to people graduating should be fired

    text: Lecturers have the right to strike like anyone else. Strikes mean  inconvenience otherwise they would be ineffective! Lecturers have demonstrated that their pay has fallen substantially behind that of other equivalent professionals and this should be addressed. The education of the students has not been affected although their results will be delayed. Some students will even benefit when they in turn become academics in the UK or get better lecturers who otherwise would have left the profession.

    text: I support my teachers over this. It is shameful the amount of salleries given to teachers at this moment. They are the backbone of any country and they should be able to carry out research and teach without having to worry about their financies. Although this is going to delay our results morally i support them.

    text: as a student at manchester university I am fed up with the whole system. If students are a few days late with payments the university send them letters (during exam time)threatening to take them to court and then make them pay an extra fifty pounds (they refuse to let you stay if you dont pay the extra money. Now they have the cheek to tell sudents that they will give them a final degree based on work they did in secnd year which means most of us will get lower grades.

      media never influence anyone, and hardly anyone goes into the media anymore, do
      they. And anyone can tell how a televison program is made or how Chomsky's five

    text: "Its not just undergrads they're affecting: I'm on a one year master's course. I
      haven't had any work back since January, and am now told that my degree may be
      based purely on the work I did before - so, on less than half the work I've done
      and on the worse half as it takes time to get used to what your lecturers want.
      But I'm still having to complete this work which is irrelevant now to both my
      degree and my job prospects. <br />I am absolutely sick of this and considering
      getting legal advice."

    text: "Students shouldn't be too worried about the threat of coursework and exams going
      unmarked. Once they get into the real world, they will realise a degree is just
      a bit of paper that will do them little, if any good at all. Most of today's
      graduates can't even spell, let alone think for themselves. Perhaps we should
      use this as an opportunity to weed out those useless media studies and marketing
      degrees."

    text: "To a postgrad thinking about entering the profession: Another 7k of debts to add
      on to the 12k you've racked up in their degree, because you've taken another 4
      years to get the MSc and PhD.  You might - if you're lucky and get a full-time
      job - start on 24k.  The very first group of students you graduate will almost
      certainly earn more than you in their first jobs...  When you're 40 you might
      earn as much as them, by which time they'll all be on 20-30k more"

      the vice chancellors (average pay rise 25% last year) with is teaching, so they
      regrettably have to use that. Which is why UCEA tried not to announce their pay
      offer until after exams - hoping to tell academics how they were reneging on the
      promises when it was too late to have any means to make UCEA listen and actually
      honour the promises made in the commons."

      not something the state should provide for the benefit of the country. This
      means that the \"student factories\" are trying to make as much money as they
      can by charging the students as much as possible and paying their staff as
      little as possible, while standards have gone down and grades have artificially
      gone up to make it seem as if things have improved. Good luck to the strikers!"
