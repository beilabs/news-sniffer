    text: "<b>Prime Minister Tony Blair has attacked the \"appalling\" behaviour of animal
      rights extremists and stressed government support for testing on animals.</b> 
      <br /><br />He says he wants people to \"stand up against the tiny group of
      extremists threatening medical research and advances in this country\". <br
      /><br />Writing in the Sunday Telegraph he suggested companies with links to
      animal testing may be allowed to keep details of their shareholders secret. His
      comments came after threats were made against around 50 GlaxoSmithKline <br
      />shareholders.  <br /><br /><b>Is the PM right to defend testing on animals?
      Should the identity of shareholders, at risk of intimidation, be protected? Do
      the actions of animal rights extremists overshadow the message of animal
      welfare? Send us your comments.</b>"

      1996 he wanted a royal commission investigation into the scientific validity of
      vivisection, however, now he is publically supporting it without any evidence of
      its validity. The big pharma companies are the thrid biggest contributor to the
      UKs economy, once again it appears that money comes before the many animal and

    text: The people who claim they support the banning of animal testing end up banding around figures and "facts" that usually have no relation to the truth. The scientists and Researchers who are a hell of a lot more intelligent than most of you want animal testing and alot of evidence supports the role of animal testing in developing cures. If you care about animals more than humans please reject medicines and drugs when you next get ill and stop being hypocrites.

    text: I am ashamed of the human race to which I have the misfortune to belong.Anything humans touch either is exterminated or becomes a complete mess.This includes the animal testing saga.Making animals suffer is sadistic and criminal.<br />Yes,I do eat meat because I am part of the food chain but I do not torment other animals.<br />Jails are full of murderers who can be used to test on for the benefit of humanity. Let us keep the testing to our own kind and keep other animal species out of it

Nevertheless we cannot afford to suspend progress in medical research without them and terrorists shouldn’t intimidate us.  Their actions only serve to backfire against them.

    text: It upsets me that no one draws a distinction between testing for cosmetics and testing for medicine.  I am absolutely against testing for cosmetics and don’t buy a product unless it has a fixed cut-off date.  There is no excuse for causing an animal pain in the name of vanity.  But drugs can save lives so it is different and I can’t say I’m against this as I use medicine.  But we do need to fund alternatives as these methods should cease.

      I want the people I know and love to live full healthy lives and accept that
      animal research has been necessary in the past to achieve this, and will
      continue to be in the future.  So for me the issue is split. No for cosmetic

Afterall how many non-human animals would be capable of this debate. And before anyone suggests otherwise that is not the same as saying one set of humans is superior to another. For the sake of humans keep testing drugs on animals.<br />And Im glad this PM has finally decided that the rights of humans are more important.

      Testing of cosmetics and other non essential items should be banned without

      that it is perhaps necesary to test these on animals before humans, but this

      cause pain and suffering to the animal concerned and under strict supervision."
