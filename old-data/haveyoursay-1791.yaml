    text: "I've been lucky. I have been a working mum since my daughter was two and a
      half... until she was 5 I worked in the college where she attended child care -
      could see her out my office window - then the week she started school I became a
      teacher in a 6th Form College. So I get the stimulation (and cash!) of working
      AND nice long holidays when she's off as well to enjoy her company. Husband's a
      teacher too, so he's around - Happy Families!!!"

    text: "What utter rubbish, just another one of the governments cheap tricks to get more
      people back to work so the figures look good.<br />Mothers should be able to
      look after their own children at home without having to worry about working. I
      was a single mum through no fault of my own and therefore forced financially to
      go back to work full time in order to pay my mortgage. I was totally exhausted
      both mentally and physically and feel I've never really recovered."

    text: "My mum isn't a 'mummy' type (and she admits it!) While at home with me, she was
      bored and resentful, and consequently I was miserable too. When I was 7 she went
      back to work - I don't know if she was healthier, but she was a lot happier and
      therefore we were all happier! My point is that a happy mum leads to a happy
      child, and that mums need the emotional and financial support to do whatever is
      right for their personality and situation, be that working or staying at home."

      going to University,but now she doesn't have to work so hard at home, she's put
