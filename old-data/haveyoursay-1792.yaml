      The US did not make deals with German and Japanees criminlas of WWI &#38; WWII,
      they made deals with the \"new\" German and Japanees allies. Would any court of
      law in this day and age do any deals with criminals and wipe off their past
      record and do deals with them? Obviously NO. Then why should we make deals with
      criminals? Well, may be polictics is diferent eh?"
