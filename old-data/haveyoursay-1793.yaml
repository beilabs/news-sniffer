      /><br />The first drought order since 1995 has been issued in England and Wales,
      banning the use of non-essential use of water.<br /><br />Under the six-month
      order, Sutton and East Surrey Water can ban car washing, the filling of swimming
      pools and watering of parks and sports grounds.<br /><br /><b>How will the
      drought order affect householders? Are you in the area affected? Are you worried
      that your area may be next? Are water companies right to restrict the use of
      water? How could bans be avoided?</b>"

    text: "This has been looming for some time. Water shortage in the SE is expected to be
      a long-term problem - unless it rains for several months, non-stop. Proposed new
      housing in the affected areas will not help matters. It is impractical to pipe
      water from 'water-rich' areas but building new homes there instead might be one
      part of a solution. This would tend to ease stress on infrastructures and spread
      economic benefits, as a proportion of businesses would have to relocate along
      with their workforce."

      over-developed and over-populated. Yet, they haven't got the water supply that
      they need in order to be able to cope with this kind of expansion.<br />

      of the water companies appears to be that we reduce the use of water untill we
      have more rain, but what if this does not happen. Surely they, with government
      need to be looking at long term strategies to solve this problem. There is
      plenty of water at the other end of country which could be piped down."

The demand for housing is in the South East and if new homes are not built supply and demand will result in huge property price rises and therefore inflation. However the government does have to force the water companies (the biggest water wasters themselves)to improve their services and possibly foot the cost of a nationwide water-grid. But ultimately the tax-payer pays.

    text: It is time the water companies looked into other ways of supplying water in the SE.If theres a surplus of water in other parts of the country then it should be moved to those areas that need it.Additionally,we live on an island,we are surrounded by water,which apparently due to global warming is rising.Build desalination plants-it isnt new technology,Arab countries have been doing it for years.We are told that these ideas are too expensive-more likely to impact on the water companies profits.

    text: The water shortage is a scandal,to suggest we have had drought conditions similar to 1976 is a joke,we are lucky if we get a few good weeks in the year but a few dry days and there is panic.I wonder how the water companies think that the continental countries manage for water,and what about Africa?That is a country with real water problems.I think any shortage of water in the UK has to be down to wastage by the companies who are making so much out of it.

    text: My area has a French owned water company that is a profitable business charging the same but being assisted by the Government to restrict supply without penalty.<br />Why allow poor leak repair results and not insist targets are met BEFORE allowing restrictions. How does Prescott justify building so many new dwellings in the south if the infrastructure cannot cope. It is time to nationalise the water industry and connect the country so water flows fron the north to the south.

    text: 9. Water meters are great and do reduce customer usage. However blanket installation for every property would cost a hugh some of money and would cause serious disruption. All new houses must have meters installed and additionally any property sold will have a meter installed regardless of whether the new owner wants one. Therefore all home will eventually be metered but at a rate that is acheiveable.
