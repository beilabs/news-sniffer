    text: "Awarding prizes for art and literature is difficult - it will always be a
      subjective judgement since there are no measurable criteria against which to
      judge.  Works of art, music and literature which are today derided as
      \"rubbish\" may become future classics - look at how Cezanne and Picasso were
      derided in their lifetime - and look at them now.  Dickens was considered
      \"popularist\" when he was live and would probably have won no prizes!"

      Mugridge can't cope with the abstract and formal terms of art, it’s best to
      stay away from uninformed criticism, or risk embarrassment. Alas, in Mr.
      Mugridge's case, it is too late now.<br />Addressing the question, there's quite
      a nice range in this year's show. Better than past years, I feel."

      that means any old junk can be art. Craftsmanship IS needed. Well-crafted pieces
      may still not be any good, but a badly-crafted piece never is. Art should also
      provoke emotion, and it's easy to cause feelings of disgust, shock, or contempt.
      A true artist can also create wonder, beauty, and excitement (and those feelings

Your masterpiece should be constructed out of everyday objects. The more controversial the better. Bonus points for using biological matter.<br /><br />3. Name your art something meaningful but unrelated. Must instill the viewer to offer an involuntary second frown or thumb and forefinger on chin!
