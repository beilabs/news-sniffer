      />Classroom staff are being asked to deal with the needs of children with
      special educational needs, such as nappy changing and emptying tracheotomy
      tubes, a report says.<br /><br />The study for the National Union of Teachers
      says the inability to meet many children’s needs could result in “extreme”
      behaviour by pupils and a sense of guilt from teachers who feel they are denying
      the rest of the class their attention.<br /><br /><b>Are the needs of all
      children being met? Are you a teacher? If so, do you teach special needs
      children? Or are you a parent who has a child with special needs? What are your
      experiences?</b>"

      couldn't do because they were trying to achieve targets and keep their

      resented her being in the class, and my daughter became very unhappy.  She moved

If you want to send your special needs child into a mainstream school expect them to be treat the same as everyone else. however more schools that cater for special needs are required in some areas and perhaps these can be merged with the mainstream schools. Share the same facilities and interact during break but have their own teachers and classrooms.

    text: "To A Patriot<br />Fair enough to what you say but my LEA has just denied my son
      a place at the high school he wants. They site the extra resources needed for
      special needs children as a reason for denying him a place. On a personal level
      therefore, I feel that the place for special needs children is in an educational
      establishment that caters for their needs. I don't see why their need outweighs
      my sons."

    text: "MLD special schools have closed and those pupils behave poorly in a main stream
      school as they do not have the small pupil/teacher ratio they had in the special
      school. In most cases they are in a class of 30 with no extra help.  No surprise
      then that they cannot cope and disrupt the teaching of that class. Teaching is
      suffering because of the money saved by closing those schools. Why?"

      between the school and the parents. Not left to a single teacher to deal with."

    text: "Surely it makes sense to put special needs children into special needs schools?
      If you put them in the mainstream, they lose out because specialist resources
      are spread thinly, as does everyone else - because teaching staff will
      concentrate more on them. If you're someone else in one of those classes it is
      rather frustrating if you can't speak to the teacher because they're busy
      dealing with someone with \"special needs\"."

    text: "\" Or is it another fancy phrase meaning naughty kids?\"<br /><br />Well, thanks
      a bunch, David. Next time my autistic, severely learning disabled son does
      something differently from how other kids do it I'll remember it's not that he's
      brain damaged, just that he's naughty. Comments like this make parents like me
      despair. Special needs is a term that covers a multitude of things, but it
      always seems to be the behaviourally challenged that people hear about."

The bright kids have human rights too.<br /><br />If kids in the class are disruptive (for what ever reason) they MUST be removed so the human rights ogf the MANY can be preserved.<br /><br />This may mean that bright kids get removed too so they are kept busy in a more focused environment

      some  psychologists do not beleive it exists as a clinical condition - i.e there
      are no common symptoms and no agreed treatment.  My impression (from
      undergraduate research) is that many teachers and some parents collude with the
      special needs label to cover for poor teaching and/or behavioural issues they
      are unable/unwilling to properly adress."

    text: My daughter has profound physical disabilities and attends a mainstream school. With her assistant she is well able to take her place in school life. She loves her school and the children in her class rush to walk alongside her wheelchair when going to school.  <br />Our local authority and school have been highly supportive and we are all delighted with her progress. Those who criticise this success should reconsider their fears prior to expressing their prejudices towards inclusive education.
