      /><br />NHS patients should be reimbursed for medical treatment in the EU if
      they face an \"undue delay\" for surgery in the UK, a court has ruled.<br /><br
      />The European Court of Justice made the decision in the case of Yvonne Watts

      if she is to have a refund.<br /><br /><b>Do you agree with the ruling? Have you

With medicine ever more complex and expensive it makes sense for EU members to spread the cost of the expertise more widely and to treat accordingly; it should promote competition and raise standards; it increases the flexibility of EU health care by spreading the burden more widely. In short is a demonstration of EU benefits that are so hard to admit.

As a result the UK parliament (our democratically elected representatives) passed the 1972 European Communities Act which gave the ECJ these powers.  In 1975 the UK electorate confirmed the decision in a referendum.<br /><br />We may not like the powers the ECJ has but we certainly voted to give them to the ECJ.

Then the NHS will become the disaster that is the railways or the energy companies. How happy people will be when they have to pay £300 /month for health insurance as the US do.

      not just maladministration, but that some operations are deliberately rationed

The argument put forward by some that this represents the "leaking of money out of the NHS" is not true as presumably these people were going to be treated on the NHS at cost to the NHS anyway so it will not cost the NHS any more.
