      I think the reason for the divorce has been the \"press\" [excluding those have
      a high prestige such as the BBC: which I like]. Another reason for the divorce
      could be the difference of age. A 27 year age difference is something to think
      about. Look at Tommy Motolla with Mariah Carey [21 year difference] although I
      think Mr. Motolla has had success with Thalia [Mexican Singer and Actress 24

      see her making a profitable book deal out of this.  Women have an easier time

      />Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills are to separate after four years of

      £200m of his £825m fortune. He rejects any suggestion that Mills married him
      for his money. <br /><br />The £200m figure is based on the recent high profile

      three years. <br /><br /><b>How should the financial side of a divorce be
