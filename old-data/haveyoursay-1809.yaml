    text: "<b>Who do you think should win Eurovision 2006?</b><br />	<br />This is the 50th
      anniversary of the pop spectacular which has introduced the world to acts like
      ABBA, Celine Dion and Bucks Fizz.<br /><br />Greece is hosting this year's
      event, which has already seen 13 countries eliminated in the semi-final. The
      Song Contest final takes place Saturday night and will be on BBC1 from 2000 BST
      hosted, as ever, by Terry Wogan.<br /><br /><b> Where will you be watching the
      show? Who do you think should win? What are the best Eurovision songs of all
      time? Why is the show so popular?</b>"

      Caucasian Armenia lies at the boundary between Asia and Europe, like Turkey,

      have shown that there's more to music in Europe than dross pop.<br /><br />The
      UK's voting shows this - Lordi, for being different, unique, and actually
      playing their own instruments, and Lithuania, for taking the mickey. The rest of
      Europe agreed.<br /><br />And I love Wogan's dry humour, it makes the show. Long

I think we have to go back to a jury and let people not vote. It does not work. Maybe we could do a European songcontest and a Balcancontest! Everyone could support eachother and it would be more pleasant and understanding for all of us.<br />By the way I was ashamed of the Dutch commantator.

    text: It is a sad comment on present day society that programs made for the "brain dead" such as the Song Contest draw the largest audiences.<br /><br />I gather that it was won by a very sick rock group which most of the Finnish people wanted banned and from which they disassociated themselves.<br /><br />Add to that the usual incestuous voting of the various neighbouring Countries and we have something of which we can all be proud!!!

    text: "Greece won the contest last year without belonging to any political or cultural
      group. Only Cyprus votes for Greece every year. So that proves that any country
      can do it. If the UK desides to send a descent song for once, i am sure it could
      win. Now, instead of making a joke of the competition every year though your
      media, just resign. You never stop telling the world how much you DONT feel
      europeans anyway. Maybe American Idol is more apropriate for you"

      long since siezed to exist between Finland and its neigbours. In the past,
      Finland has maybe got 1 or 2 \"pity\"-points from its neighbours - lets face it

      couple of academics last week who investigated this.  From what I recall one of
      them said that it was a recent phenomenon and that it comprises about one third
      of the votes.<br /><br />Also, bear in mind, that Eurovision is increasingly
      done by televoting rather than judges."

      Euroland have spoken and voted for what they listen to, which is NOT dull, banal

      have seen the faces on the puffed up judges &#38; commentators who were all

      To those who would dis the genre on principle I would remind them that Sir Cliff
      Richard - “Congratulations” Finland, by the way - was once deemed to be a

      brightened only slightly by the increasingly funny Terry Wogan.<br /><br />Now,
      while it still has the same annoying repetitive pop 'anthems' by the majority of
      countries, at least Finland had the sense to try and promote something
      different. I've been a Lordi fan for a couple of years now - they're not
      satanic, they're just a bit of fun. All of those protesting because it's against
      their religions - grow up and lighten up."

      The UK entries have been mediocre for years, therefore the low points they

      agree that UK has become a culturally isolated country. Also, I can't see a

      Eurovision and I enjoyed every minute of it.  Congratulations to Lordi for
      showing that a genuine rock song will beat the vacuous pop hands down. Never
      mind their gimic, they showed that nothing compares chugging guitars and strong
      vocals! <br /><br />Also 10/10 to Terry Wogan - the man was comic genius
      throughout."

      /><br />Is it any wonder the UK never wins? We keep entering Rap / Dance / DnB /
      R&#38;B rubbish, and that isnt what eurovision is about. Noone else in europe
      likes this stuff! We need to enter some pop / rock acts to stand a chance.<br
      /><br />Political voting plays a part (ie what songs are publicised in various
      countries more than others before the contest), but i think the music counts
      towards most of it."

      has always been about either kitsch acts or, more often, terribly bland ballards
      and Europop - it's always been a joke.  Lordi won because for the first time,
      rock fans across Europe watched and voted - because it was the best song and the
      most credible act.  And when the most credible act is a bunch of men in monster
      suits, it just tells you about the quality of the other entries..."

      poorly imitating hip-hop and pop videos with their booty-shaking moves, that's
      what the ESC has become. The songs resemble each other more and more every year,
      and it was refreshing to see something different. The ESC is about entertainment
      and Lordi put up an excellent show. The show is not about musical talent - If it
      was, then most of this year's contenders shouldn't have even been there."
