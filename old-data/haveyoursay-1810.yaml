    text: "Ali from Tehran, I realise that as an Iranian you're kind of biased, but I
      really can't let your posting pass without comment. Firstly, Saddam was not
      'heavily backed' by the US - that is a myth. They sold him a tiny proportion of
      his total arms and equipment, the vast majority was from France, Germany, China
      and Russia. Secondly, to claim that the coalition have killed more Iraqis than
      Saddam's regime is simply untrue."

    text: I spent 1 year in Iraq for the US Army traveling 50,000 km through the entire country regularly in contact with many of the people of Iraq.  Some of the issues why raq not seeing progress is due to the lack of a central government.  (from a state monopoly on fuel to lack of taxation for federal spending)  The list goes on and on..  These are structural decisions that cannot be imposed from any outside government.
