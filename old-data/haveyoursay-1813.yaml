    text: "<b>Is Tony Blair right to put nuclear power 'back on the agenda'?</b><br /><br
      />In a speech later today the prime minister will say that Britain may become
      dependent on imported gas to meet future energy needs.<br /><br />Mr Blair has
      seen a first draft of the government-commissioned energy review (due in July),
      and concluded that \"the replacement of nuclear power stations, a big push on
      renewables and a step change on energy efficiency\" is the answer.<br /><br
      /><b>What is your reaction to Mr Blair's speech? Has the nuclear decision
      already been taken? Are there any alternatives? </b>"

      technology.<br /><br />Where we fail is in getting into action on waste
      disposal.  There have been committees and enquiries for too long.  The longer we
      go on talking the harder the politics gets.  Lets get off the pot, make a
      rational decision, and build the long term waste repository we need.  Then we
      can build the power stations again."

      base load, and these plants have only 5-6 years left in them before they need to
      be decommissioned. It’s my opinion that new nuclear plants MUST be constructed
      ASAP due to long construction times.<br />Yes construction and decommissioning
      costs are high, but actual running costs once constructed are relatively low
      when compared with other fuels. Personally I see no other realistic alternative

This would be very green and would use a natural source that appears daily.  Small wind turbines per household would also generate electricity using yet another natural resourse. There are so many other options available without going nuclear.

    text: Fear of nuclear power are short-sighted and irrational.  Critics rarely understand it and at the same time offer no credible alternative (esp. renewables).  It is safe and will operate for decades without leaving us at the mercy of unreliable gas/oil producing nations.  It has implications re. waste but these could be solved if the govt was willing to a)plan ahead and b)make difficult decisions when it comes to the environment.  I have yet to hear a better (reasoned) solution.

No it is not the only answer. Every pound we have to spend on nuclear will deliver a fraction of the CO2 reduction of every pound we can spend on energy efficiency and decentralised energy.<br /><br />Centralised big power plants are hugely inefficient and dated.

    text: 3 months ago I migrated from Cheshire to New Zealand. New Zealand gets about 60% of its electricity from renewable resources (admittedly we have some geothermal resources but most of this comes from hydro-electic plants). New Zealand is a nuclear-free country and elctricity here is cheaper than in UK. Mr.Balir should do his maths again and think of the future.

      if the energy demand crisis is to be met, and contries like China and India
      appeased in their demand for energy, then this seems the only logical way
      forward. If we lead the way and drive the technology, who knows, we might make
      some economic gain from it by selling skills and infrastructure.<br /><br />To

Nuclear energy is definitely back on the agenda and should be there while other alternatives are being explored. The building of a new generation of nuclear power makes good common sense and should be the key plank for future government energy reviews. The PM is being realistic and should be congratulated for that.

    text: "To dismiss a few myths, nuclear is cheap, total costs including decommissioning,
      nuclear costs ~ 2.0p/KWh compared to ~ 3.5p/KWh for coal, around 3.0p/KWh for
      gas, 5.5p/KWh for oil and over 7.5p/KWh for wind.  Secondly nuclear is safe,
      no-one has ever died at a UK nuclear site, this is not true for coal, gas, or
      even wind.  What we need is to maintain a prudent mix of fuel types including
      coal, gas, nuclear &#38; renewables and Tony Blair should be praised for this
      brave and far-sighted decision"

      me if I'm wrong but uranium is dug out of the ground in far-flung parts of the

      loaded onto ships, transported to this country and distributed by road and rail.
      Unless we have suddenly discovered uranium mines in this country I don't see how
      this is different from coal/gas/oil imports."

      issue into this debate – it’s irrelevant. The reason the International
      Community is trying to stop Iran is not because they don’t want them
      generating nuclear energy. It is because they believe that Iran is using energy
      generation as a cover for developing atomic weapons, which in the hands of a
      fundamentalist state like Iran would be a frightening prospect!"

    text: Please spare me from the comments about how tidal and wind pwer could be done so much easier and safer. Yes its theoreticaly safer and greener but it will never happen. This country is full of people who are quite happy for windpower and tidal to be built as long as its "somewhere else". NIMBY mentality will scupper every chance for alternative power generation. <br /><br />Easier to get one nuclear plant built than a lot of Windmill / tidal plants.

      radioactive waste which will remain dangerous for around 10 000 years (during

      costly to the tax payer and by the time the initial investment has 'paid off'
      (about 20-30 years) we could have quite feasibility used the cash to bring other
      sources up to the required efficiency and productivity."

    text: "ENERGY is under review - not just electricity - only about 1/5 of energy use -
      nuclear is about 1/5 of that (4%). Most energy use is domestic heating and
      transport, but they're boring. Domestic conservation is low skilled, high
      employment and low profit. Slow, economical cars and trucks are similar. High
      tech, high security risk, electrical power offers more money for highly
      articulate, highly paid, and actively voting professionals. Government and the
