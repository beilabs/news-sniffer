    text: "<b>Should the government fund more subsidised rural housing?</b><br /><br />A
      government back group has called for more subsidised housing in rural areas of
      England.  A report from the Rural Housing Commission says 11,000 new homes a
      year must be built to help stop low-earners being priced out of rural areas.<br
      /><br />Commission chair Elinor Goodman said: \"The issue of second homes was
      not a major problem across the country but was a real concern in some areas
      where there was a disproportionately high number.\" <br /><br /><b>Are you a
      first time buyer in a rural area? What effect do you think building more homes
      in rural areas will have? Do you think second home owners and commuters in rural
      areas are causing housing problems? Send us your comments.</b>"

      snapped up as investments by \"townies\" looking for a second home or holiday
      rental property. It does not matter what price is initially put on new housing,
      market pressures will very quickly force prices upwards defeating the original
      idea behind this proposal. The government must make second homes or holiday lets
      unprofitable if it really wants to address this problem."

      government was to buy some cheap rural land, several of these houses could be
      built fairly cheaply.  Then rather than being sold at market value be sold at
      say 10% but only to certain people... ie. those under 25 (to bring a little
      youth to rural areas), and those earning less than £25k per year.<br /><br
      />Simply tie them into a contract which says they cant move for 10 years without
      forfieting the profit, and you can call it modern social housing.<br /><br />New
      property, new life to rural areas, and for those on smaller incomes who do the
      hard work."

    text: "\"There are lots of comments suggesting second home owners pay more council tax.
      My understanding is that council tax although called a tax is actually a charge
      for services rendered and as such it is not legal to charge more. <br />On a
      slightly different note, if all the second home owners left and
      resicents/service users moved in, council tax would have to increase for
      everyone as demand for services increased.<br /><br />H R, United Kingdom\"<br

      found that, even in Surrey, where land and affordable housing was at a premium,
      too many plots had luxury housing built on them, lessening the possibilities of

Surely if their was truly a housing shortage then estate agents would be closing down all over the place. House price rises have been engineeered by estate agents and developers to make maximum profit! If you really want affordable housing then stop playing along to their game. Everyone should boycott estate agents until prices become more realistic!

No wonder more people are now having to buy half or quater of a house with a building association.

      not all got our houses cheap and have to work hard to keep up!<br />However,
      these days many of the people who get council houses are not the hardworking,

      benefit from this whereas others who try to work hard and contribute struggle."

      the coctors / nurses / gardeners / carers who will look after us as we die? It's

      in this area is in the region of £250,000  but there are more people earning
      £15,000 - £20,000 than anything else and don't have a hope of buying their own
      home.  A one-bedroomed flat is in the region of £100,000 !"

      cabbage fields outside of Dover and Folkstone or the apple orchards around
      Tonbridge and Headcorn and try talking to some one. You will soon be moved on by
      some one who really dose not want to much attention drawn to his work force.<br

      at work, isn't that what we are meant to applaud?"

      show immigrant children do worse at school have more use of the nhs etc.<br
      />MrsBrady Oldlady <br /><br />Actually you are wrong - ALL stats for immigrant
      show the same - migrants do the rubbish jobs as they want their children to
      achieve so they encourage schooling. Migrant children are the doctors of
      tomorrow. Migrants use -worldwide-  the NHS less as they are trying to acheieve,
      not skive lots like the local popualtion."

    text: "Of course high levels of immigration are a big part of the problem! If you
      increase the population substantially then you need more housing, no two ways
      about it. <br /><br />Michael Jamieson <br />No, we are dying off - especially
      in the very near future. And we are not increasing it with immigration much."

      person who wants more benefits!  I was on a reasonable wage (not huge), and
      stayed in a job I did not particularly want to do to get my first flat.  I got
      no benefits, and it was not very long ago.<br />Stop asking other people to fund
      you - take responsibility and perhaps, heaven forbid, change things, and your
      lifestyle to attain at least some of what you want to, whether that change is
      nice or not."
