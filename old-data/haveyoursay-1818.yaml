      might be of interest: <br /><br />Last year in the UK 22% of all carbon
      emissions came from transport. <br />Only 12% of this 22% came from aviation.
      <br />So only 2.6% of this nations total carbon emissions come from aviation.
      <br />The vast majority eminate from power plants and domestic heating."

    text: Not many airports/airlines can handle the A-380. It takes 3  hours just to board the 747. I dread to think of the hours I will have to wait to get on this huge plane. Big plane does not mean more room. It is more economic to squeeze in as many passengers in a plane to reduce the cost per passenger in a plane especially with current gas prices. I doubt if the A-380 can fly non-stop from America to Asia.

I can only imagine what safety this plane has.

      environmentally friendly than 'older' aircraft: this allows a comparison to
      air-choking 1970's models. If planes of this size are allowed to land in the UK,
      they should be restricted to airports far from any urban centre where noise and
      pollution have the least effect. Suggest a remote part of Scotland - not London
      where they will aggravate millions!"

      - with bars and lounges inside the huge aeroplane.  By the time the airlines get
      hold of it the insides will be just the same as every other plane in service
      with tiny seats, cramped aisles, irritating neighbours and terrible food.  Yes,
      it is an engineering marvel, but it won't have any effect on travellers."

      fuel. The A380 flies in the established 30,000  feet bracket (due to its
      weight)where air resistance causing drag uses more fuel. The A380 is only a very
      minor technological step forward at a time when we needed a giant leap. Regards"

      the A380, that will define Airbus' success or failure in the future.  Airbus'
      scramble to redesign the A350 not once, but now twice in light of the 787s
      sales, and their cut-rate pricing on the A320s last December to retain the sales
      crown in response to the success of the 737-800 is evidence enough ot this."

      door as they currently do with most other aircraft.  A 747 has 8 doors and yet
      they only ever use one meaning it can take seemingly forever to get everyone off
      the aircraft. For me, disembarking is the worst part of the journey."

      achieved, to think that in a century we have progressed from a plane made
      primarily from wood and cloth to a plane of technological genius. Many thought
      it was a step backwards when Concorde went out of service, this just proves our
      ability to progress forwards!"

      I will fly it as soon as I can. However as a traveller I would love to think
      that Boeing or Airbus were about to launch a newer and larger version of
      Concorde, something that could travel large distances at incredible speeds. Most
      A380's will be a lot more spacious and comfortable than current jets, I just
      want something much faster. Neither the 787 or A380 acheives this."

    text: "The wake of the A380 is larger than than the 747. This meant for now that the
      landing slot for a A380 is 2 747's. (11 miles) Airports had to widen their
      airstrips to accomodate for the A380 and only a few airports worldwide have
      airports that are suitable for an A380. With an incident with this 555 seater
      plane there is the likelyhood of more casualties. Is the A380 therefor a real
      improvement?"

    text: "Apart from being the ugliest aircraft in the skies, I simply don't trust Airbus
      jets.  They seem to crash too often, so I'd rather stick to Boeing.  In any
      event, the A380 is too big for most airports and will probably be a financial
      disaster.  No wonder BAe want to sell their share in Airbus Industries.  Boeing
      has got it right with the Dreamliner, which is more efficient and can fly
      further, and Airbus wont have an answer to that until 2012."
