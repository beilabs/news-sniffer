    text: "<b>Are you going to see the film? Is the story sacrilegious?</b><br /><br
      />Christian groups in many Asian nations have stepped up their protests against
      the blockbuster ahead of its global release this week.<br /><br />The story,
      adapted from Dan Brown’s multi-million selling book, hinges on the theory that
      Jesus married Mary Magdalene.<br /><br />In Thailand censors are to cut the last
      10 minutes of the film for being \"blasphemous\".<br /><br /><b>Why do you think
      the story has done so well? What do you think of the way the story deals with
      religion? Are you going to see the film? Send us your views and
      experiences.</b>"

      it is a work of fiction.  People are taking it far too seriously instead of
      enjoying it as the excellent, exciting and well-written story that it actually

      Look at the Apocrypha - whole chunks of the bible cut out due to religious
      disagreements amongst a handful of old men.  One man's sacrilege is another
      man's gospel.  The church is fanning the flames of publicity by acting as though
      the Da Vinci Code is anything other than entertainment."

If this had been a film about islam or any other religion all hell would have broken loose but because christianity (not catholisim which is a false religion) preaches no revenge we are an easy target. Even the Romans who murdered Jesus admit he rose again on the third day. But this is just one of a long line of films and programmes to slate christianity and the bbc is one of the biggset guilty parties in this.

      and what is not?<br /><br />It's a bit like asking me to comment whether the
      England football team should have a foreign manager. I don't follow football, I
      don't care, because it's only a game so why should anyone take my opinion

      rather than demonstrating a much better way.<br />My God is big enough to cope

      fade away very shortly. On the other side, the true Gospel of Jesus Christ has
      endured throughout history for over 2,000 years, and until the end of
      times...<br /><br />\"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other

    text: One theme of the book is that of suppression by the church of beliefs that are counter to their own. Complaints about the book and film are an extension of this suppression.<br />Is this an attempt to have the same power to suppress opinions that we allow Islam at the moment. Any similar film around Islam would be censored out of existance. I hold all religions up to the same degree of ridicule and believe that there should be no blasphemy laws of any sort in favour of any religion.

The points made in the Da Vinci Code are no more of a myth than the story of the "Son of God" or the Christian creation story. Neither has solid proof.

Pehaps if the Gospel according to Mary Magdalene had survived then we would be singing a different tune. As it is the newly translated Gospel according to Judas Escariot quite cleary shows that Jesus had a very close relationship with her and even stayed the night together Scandalous in that era.

      even labelled \"based on truth\", which usually means the characters are real,

      \"known\" facts, the outcome of certain events is given due recognition and the

    text: I think there is a great difference between the belief in a supreme creator and the doctrine of religious organisations. It does seem to me that those not following religious doctrine are more moral and ethical than those that do because their judgement is less biased.<br />The Bible has provably been rewritten and there is no historical proof of the existence of Jesus whose story parallels that of Isis and Horus.Devout Belief is not provable fact.

    text: "If Dan Brown is so wrong, then what's the official reason for Christianity and
      Catholicism's subjugation of women? <br />The Bible and the stories surrounding
      Jesus are politics, written by men with their own agenda, and translated,
      altered and reinterpreted by others with their agendas throughout the ages.
      Perhaps Jesus did exist, but it's more plausible to believe he had a wife and
      kids than he was born to a virgin impregnated by God."

Most of the strife in the world is down to religion. Why do we not have a debate among the leaders of the main religions to say why their version is correct as against the others.

      even if not, they threaten the patriarchal way in which the Catholic Church has

      more such films, the better, in my humble opinion. However, the best way to do
      this is to make fun of religion, and, YES, religious people. And the best film
      about religion ever, EVER, is Monty Python's \"Life of Brian\". The best written
      word about religion ever is in \"The Salmon of Doubt\", Douglas Adams

      in these times is proof enough. It's obvious that people who insist on proof of
      God seek that proof because they want to believe. Otherwise why bother to waste
      your time asking?  Some religious institutions may seem archaic to you (that’s
      understandable), but personal faith in God or a greater, divine being does exist
      and that is the foundation of our beliefs. Religion will never be a sham when
      true faith continues to exist."

      recent history: the sexual abuse scandal, the Vatican bank scandal, and the
      Vatican's role during WWII are clear examples.  One can only imagine what other

      idea is interesting, and it owes much of its popularity to our society's love of
      scandal and controversy. The only problem I have with it is the \"fact\" page at

      shame, as I thought the book was pretty rubbish too.  I had hoped that maybe the
      film stood a chance of taking the excellent storyline that the book came up with
      and rescuing it from underneath the absolute scrap-heap that is Dan Brown's
      \"writing style\" (or more accurately a lack thereof)."

      you want to believe in (or not). Like anything, its your choice. Who are the
      Church to say its fiction? Surely if the story were to be “blasphemous” it
      would need to state it was true, or based on a true story? By creating a Da

      are unlikely to make jokes about any other religions, especially the Abrahamic
      ones. Those of no faith, who may live in 'Christian' countries, tend to find all
      religions incomprehensible and often joke about them."

Anyone who knows anything about the period in time which Dan Brown is talking about knows that what he says is pure fiction. Its possible to find out exactly how and why the bible we have today was put together. It looks like a good movie! hopefully this film will encourage people to see what the bible and christains have to say about Jesus and Christianity.

If you believe strongly in something then stand by that belief or idea but allow others to question yours and have their own.  At the point people can do that greater things might be accomplished and worrying about things like the Da Vinci Code would be considered a waste of time.  LIKE IT IS!

      and laid out a doctrine of the full humanity and full divinity of Jesus. Thus
      all true Catholics must believe that Christ had a complete human nature - which
      includes attraction to the opposite sex."

      of other questions, like: Isn't it coincidental that the timing of Christmas and
      Easter are taken directly from pagan holidays?"

      The same goes for the over-hyped film's backers.  I think Tom Hanks' best work

      pedestrian in pace and so utterly devoid of suspense that the end is obvious
      from about page 20.  Without the sensational aspect of the Jesus connection it
      would have been remaindered long ago.  It's not surprising that those who have
      seen the film have categorised it as boring.  There are far better thrillers out
      there and far better books on religous conspiracies for those who like this kind
      of idle speculation."

It is not only confused and confusing but seriuosly misleading to those who are searching the truth about Christianity. It breaks all the possible laws of homiletics and hermeneutics. To remain sane read it just like a Shakespeare play or a fiction novel. The bible will defend itself as it has been attacked from time immemorial until now. Its a money thing.

      consider this.  Holocost denial, simply by speaking your mind on the subject
      with friends, is literally a crime in many European countries.  Is that not the
      same as enforced blasphemy laws?  I remind you that Jesus Christ was a Jew and
      blasphemy was upheld as a crime when the church had a lot more control over
      Europe, and it still is a crime in some countries."

      book,and so he presents it as though he really beliees in this trite and boring
      little story of a cover up.Question is;How did he survive a Roman Crucifiction?"

    text: I have just seen the film and I liked it! It puts forward a very interesting idea that women were excluded because of prejudice. This makes sense in the light of the past treatment of women who were persecuted for healing the sick and accused of being witches. Both when reading the book and seeing the film I found myself saying-"Yes!" The film is intelligent and respectful. Congratulations!

    text: I saw a documentary last night which investigated the claims made in the book.  1. The priest at Riennes Le Chateau never found anything significant. His "fortune" was simply what he overcharged parishoners for masses never performed.  2. The modern day Priory of Sion was a complete fake.  3. The mysterious book of Phillip contains no evidence Jesus was married. The "kiss" phrase was misinterpreted. It was a common practice among early Christians. The story is full of holes.

    text: I read the book and thought the story is facinating. But typically too much is being made out about the book to give a commercial hype. This is what we call making a mountain out of mole hill. I am glad the movie is being released and I will ultimately watch it but not untill the queue has died down and the cinema comes to my neighbourhood cheap movie house.

      the DVC is blasphemous. It's not so much because the claims are not true, but
      because Christians LOVE their Master, Jesus Christ, Who has died on the cross to
      save them, and to bring them eternal life, where they will glorify Him and the
      Father. Our faith is (or, if not: should be!) strong enough to bear these

This problem is though when the media pick and choose.<br /><br />If you are too scared to even show cartoons about the muslims prophet then you should not show films about the Christians god.<br /><br />People may think they are being open minded by watching the film but they forget that they are only able to see a film supposedly about jesus because the media is too scared to present another religion.

      genuine. Fabrications posing as facts. No wonder critics panned the book and the
      film.  <br /><br />Of course, both pander to the reader and viewer, so success
      is almost preordained. Tell them they're clever and they'll buy your nonsense."

No one is saying that Jesus really and truely "slept around" but then again no one can prove if he really and truely did or did not. Both the book and the movie should be viewed as fiction and with open minds on the subject. I am a devout Christian and the Da Vinci code is one of my favorite books.

    text: "Calling the movie a \"fiction\" or \"not fiction\" doesn't get to the core of
      the problem. The Bible itself has plenty of passages that are not to be taken
      literally. But that's not the point of the Bible. If you nitpick every little
      passage you'd lose the message of the stories. Do we dismiss the moral of
      Aesop's Fables because they're fiction? That being said, the problem with Da
      Vinci Code is that it is bad as a fiction, with no consistent message."

      a C of E vicar many years ago as something accepted by some clergymen as being
      true but which they did not think most of their parishioners were ready to
      accept. He also used to tease his congregation by preaching sermons which had
      double meanings - conventional to some but with a different interpretation to
      those who knew his real beliefs. Quite fascinating."

      has wimped out, due to pressure from the religious right.  It seems to me that
      some of the edge of the message of the book was softened as Langdon sat firmly
      on the fence up until the very end.  Regardless of my feelings on the subject

If ever it happend it is a one man to one wife which is righteous in the eyes of God.

      need empirical evidence to affirm their beliefs. So when someone comes up with a
      new slant on the \"facts\" why do they get so upset? Why does it matter if
      they’ve got faith?"

      out, most notably the final page from the book!! Most disappointing. I am a big

    text: Years ago this film would have never been made because many were raised in the church and knew of truths from the book.In these days most do not know the knowledge of the bible and are subject to many deceptions from the actual written word.They call it fiction but yet underneath offers a lie to many to deny the truth and those recievers of their own golden calf (awards)receive accolades but yet add to the raping of the real story.

    text: I think the writer of this book should be ashamed of himself. If this had been a film about islam or any other religion all hell would have broken loose but because christianity (not catholisim which is a false religion) preaches no revenge we are an easy target. Even the Romans who murdered Jesus admit he rose again on the third day. But this is just one of a long line of films and programmes to slate christianity and the bbc is one of the biggset guilty parties in this.

      \"blasphemous\" just because it talks about a cult &#38; lets face it,
      christianity IS a cult no matter which way u look @ it. If people really do get
      offended by it then do the proper thing &#38; NOT worry about it. Every one has
      thoughts &#38; believes that will always contradict others. Live with it."

    text: "\"Does Phil Gale not realise that all religious works are peices of 'historical
      fiction' including the bible.\" - Richard Davie, UK<br /><br />Actually, that
      can't be proven either; it's a matter of your lack of belief. I sense a desire,
      on the part of many HYS non-believers, to impose your lack of faith on others; a
      blatant intolerance based on arrogance. There's an amusing contradiction that
      you arrived at this closed minded position by being rational."

    text: "\"I have every right to question and criticise religious beliefs if I want to.\"
      - Max Lewis, UK<br /><br />Do Christians also have a right to question and
      criticize your beliefs or lack there of? Do Christians have a right to defend
      their beliefs?<br /><br />I'm not very religious; but I notice a lack of
      tolerance by leftists for anything Christian. Will you leftists admit that? I
      notice some rationalize their intolerance because of their percieved superior
      postion."
