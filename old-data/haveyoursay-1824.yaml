      />Tributes are being paid to Kiyan Prince, the 15-year-old boy stabbed to death
      outside the gates of his school in north-west London.<br /><br />This comes as
      airport-style scanners – manned by the Metropolitan Police – are introduced
      into a London college to stop students carrying knives into the classroom. <br
      /><br /><b>How can schools deal with knives? Do classrooms need greater security
      measures? What is security like in your country’s schools? What are your
      experiences of violence in school?</b>"

When kids realise they can be sent to prison or held in juvenile homes for a lengthy period then they will think twice before committing such crimes. Deterrents are what is needed here. Schools should know who are the troubled kids and intervene and counselling could help give these kids direction and self esteem.

There is too much freedom for the young as there can be some parents’ disengagement from the healthy upbringing of their children. The school should be a safe place. Sending one’s children to it should not become like sending them to war and keeping one’s fingers crossed for their safe return. Students groups should not turn into gangs. Doing nothing about school violence is like standing arms crossed in face of terrorism.

      there is absolutely no easy fix. You put in metal detectors - the stabbing will
      just happen outside. The problem is that often students know information that
      could save lives, but do not trust the police or teachers enough to tell them.
      Knives should be made extremely hard to buy. Every school needs to have at least
      one security guard. That would be laying the foundations."
