      revelation that almost 300 prisoners have absconded from an open prison in the
      last three years is the latest in a series of embarrassments for the Home
      Office.<br /><br />Victims of crime could be given a say on when offenders
      should be released from prison under plans being considered by Home Secretary
      John Reid.<br /> <br /><b>Would dividing up the Home Office avoid further
      errors? Do you think that victims have a right to decide the length of
      offenders' prison sentences? Would this infringe the human rights of offenders?

We are told illegal immigrants are loose on the streets,Prisoners are absconding from our jails,and no-one knows how many other undesirables are at large. All of this is gearing up to persuading the public that it is in your interest to carry an ID card.DO NOT BE FOOLED! This is all "smoke and mirrors" to whip up public opinion,it is the oldest political "trick in the book".

    text: "John Reid's plans to give victims of crime a chance to influence prison
      sentences smacks of tyranny by majority and another nod to tabloid populism from
      a Government who, at best, can be credited with realising that their most
      powerful ally is Rupert Murdoch and his links with three and a half million
      gullible Sun readers.<br /><br />Splitting the Home Office would be a difficult
      and costly procedure and I suspect any benefits would be negligible in
