    text: "<b>What can be done to track illegal immigrants within the UK?</b><br /><br
      />Home Secretary John Reid has admitted that he does not know how many illegal
      immigrants there are in the UK.<br /><br />His comments follow those made by the
      UK's head of immigration removals who told MPs that he did not have \"the
      faintest idea\" of exact figures.<br /><br /><b>What more can the government do
      to tackle illegal immigration? How should the system be improved? What lessons
      could be learnt from other countries? Send us your comments.</b>"

      Secondly, immediate deportation if found to be in the country without proper

Extremely harsh punishments for companies employing them would help as would an end to the human rights legal bandwagon ran by unscrupulous lawyers intent on raking as much money from the taxpayer as possible. People who support these illegals are also supporting the trading of them by overseas crime syndicates.

Send them back to the last country they came from and make sure they cannot re-enter.

      we have so so much legal/illegal immigration. But this needs to be dealt with as
      it is putting a huge strain on our resources and our benefits system. The UK's
      health, education, pension systems (and more) are underfunded and we cannot
      afford to dish out anymore money on benefits, debate, housing etc etc etc. We
      need to tighten the border controls and legal system."

They identify loads of illegals but have nowhere to report to. They even have people who have come into the country on temporary visas deliberately trying to onto dotors list to get into hospitals for operations. <br /><br />Start There !

If the government really wanted to find them they could. However I think the government think the cost of finding them and deporting them quickly is too high. The thing that really annoys me is the fact that these takeaway owners are abusing the situation and most importantly the people.

Immigrants would register then without fear of victimization or prejudice. A climate of anti-immigrant hysteria currently pervades the national scene. This has got to stop. Legal immigrants have contributed immensely to the success of the United Kingdom.

English enables them to move on from the U.K. to other English speaking countries that have higher standards of living.  Spanish is also an option but who wants to emigrate to South America.  They should be screened more thoroughly before entering any country outside of their own.

      invite them to register with municipalities.  This voluntary registration will
      write a large percentage of illegal identity into a comprehensive list.  We
      should explain that all those who register will be evaluated on a fair basis,
      regarding work ethics and family rooting, for legal status of some type.  The
      assumption will be  that those who are not registered are acting with
      suspicion."

      establish the number of illegal immigrants; by definition.  So on what basis
      does the minister suppose it will take 10 years to deport all such
      immigrants.<br /><br />The truth is the problem is completely out of hand and
      the longer this government is in charge the more drastic will be the solution."

      allowed to go too far and is now out of control.<br /><br />It doesn't pay to be
      a good citizen in this country anymore. There are too many problems caused by
      this incompetent government now to be fixed in a reasonable amount of time, i.e.
      less than 10 years. This country is rotten at the core. Only solution for a
      decent life is to go and contribute to a decent society. I suggest Canada or may
      be Spain. Become an immigrant!"

    text: "The real problem is fear of being labelled racist.  I am a London policeman
      dealing weekly with families from other countries.  The question social, health
      and education workers really don't want to ask is \"what is their status in the
      UK?\".  Raise it and get withering looks.  It is simple to identify an illegal
      immigrant.  If they don't speak English, or has a strong accent, phone
      Immigration and ask their status.  If Immigration have never heard of them, they
      are almost certainly illegal."

      i know lot of people that are in the UK saying they get all benefits, housing,
      etc, and never worked. This is so humiliating for the UK citizens that
      participate to the economy. Hunt them, go in bars, resto, do check up"

      this is a a bit extreme and way too non PC but something has to be done to get
      rid of our image as a soft touch. Lets face it we are one of the most northern
      euro countrys, these immigrants are bypassing a lot of other just as good
      countrys to get to us. Get rid of the soft touch image and i bet half of those
      would go elsewhere."
