      children are put off by the news tastes of the new school menu ( ie they

      into giving them packed lunches. Now if the parents have not given their

      considered a revolution at the time because kids would actually eat it, instead
      of throwing it away and survivng the day on sweets! So before we condemn junk

    text: The government has a responsibility to provide wholesome meals at school canteens. So this worthy nutritional initiative by Jamie Oliver should blaze an essential trail in healthy eating habits in all schools. Had this idea caught on earlier we would be having much healthier citizens now. Better late than never is very apt in this context. Parents should have better communication with school authorities to ensure that children are never served junk food in schools.

    text: I think this move to improve school meals is great and fundamental to the health and development of this nations new generation. A next step should be to teach kids how to cook tasty and healthy meals. J.Oliver is brilliant at that. His cook books allow anybody to learn to make a decent meal and enjoy food.

      want a school lunch they have to queue most of their lunch break and then eat
      quickly, standing up. The schools admit that they can only cope by allowing the

      of a lifetime?My son complained about the school meals so as a conciencious
      parent I opted to make his packed lunch every morning.That way I know exactly
      what he's eating &#38; what goodness he's getting for lunch. I give him a choice
      and there is NEVER any rubbish in the lunchbox.Don't parents care anymore?Stop
      leaving it up to other people to make sure our children are healthy.More P.E. is
      also a good thing for them."

      shirked that responsibility at home through ignorance, neglect, having no
      backbone to stand up to their little darlings' requests or even deliberatly
