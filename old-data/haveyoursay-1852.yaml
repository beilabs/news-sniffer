      rush?  A lot of students would benefit from a year away from education and
      exams.  But the system needs a more thorough overhaul to remove bias.  The
      universities do not need know the sex, race, age, class, religion, and
      especially, the school attended by the applicant.  Assessment should be 'blind'
      of these factors and just based on the results attained, a personal statement
      and references."
