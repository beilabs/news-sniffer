    text: "<b>Does the sale and use of illegal drugs blight your neighbourhood?</b><br
      /><br />Three quarters of people in the UK say drugs are a problem in their
      neighbourhood, according to a BBC survey.<br /><br />More than half of the 1,190
      people surveyed by ICM also said they thought the police were not doing enough
      to combat the drugs problem.<br /><br /><b>Have you been affected by drugs in
      your area? Are the police doing enough to tackle the problem? What more can be
      done? Have you, or anyone you know been affected personally by illegal drug
      use?</b>"

      of people is a standard way of collecting data, especially sicne it fits in with

Our practice runs a clinic to help cope with the problem. We provide substitute opiates for heroin users who want help and other support. Drug related crime has fallen by over 50% in this area since the service has been running. <br />Surrounding Herefordshire villages are also full of drug problems. This is not just an inner city problem.

    text: Drugs are a global issue. The best way to tackle it is by enforcing mandatory drug education classes in high schools. By doing this students can learn the dire consequences of different drugs and the tolls and repercussions of usage. I lost a close friend in University from an extasy overdose. It was one of the worst days of my life. What angers me the most is/was that this could have been prevented.

    text: "I get angry about this, and I know what I am talking about. Drug taking is fun
      at first, because it challenges the authority of your parents and society as a
      whole. It is also perversely encouraged by the media: The glamorous, rich
      celebrities with their widely-reported drug habits. The djs on radio who make
      drug references. Fact is, drug taking carves a hole in your life which you fill
      by taking more drugs."

    text: "It is my strong believe that a \"war on drugs\" has the opposite effect from
      what it is trying to achieve: more users and more drugrelated crime (figures
      show this). Hard drugs are a problem, yes, but I believe in a practical way of
      dealing with the issue, not an almost religious anti-drugs fervour. Don't spend
      all your money on policing, but bring the problem out in the open, don't give
      criminals a chance, and try to solve the underlying issues that cause people to
      use drugs."

    text: yes drugs are a real problem across the world but there is an even larger problem that receives little or no support for the sufferers and others and that is alchoholisiam.<br /><br />if you are a drug usere you get lots of help and support but alchoholics get little or none and the are many more alchoholics in this country than peapole with a drug problem and the death toll for alchoholics compared to drug users is 9 to 1.

      communities and society destroy users and dealers.<br /><br />Let's get back to
      good ol' fashion people policing since apparently the cops are miserable at
      stopping crime."
