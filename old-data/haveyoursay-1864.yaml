      which labels Nottingham as the most crime-ridden place in England and Wales has
      been condemned by city officials as “fatally flawed”.<br /><br />Based on
      calculations using data on burglary, murder, rape, robbery and car crime
      Nottingham was found to have the highest crime levels overall and the highest
      murder rate.<br /><br /><b>Do you live in Nottingham? If so, do you agree with

      crime in your town or city? Send us your experiences.</b>"

    text: "Living in leicester (top for assaults) and visitng Nottingham regularly I think
      both places are actually safer than they used to be. Leicester in the early to
      mid 80s really was dangerous on a firday or saturday night. I'm sure that there
      is a lot of assault but it seems to be mostly between young blokes who know each
      other.<br /><br />The trouble with these kind of reports is that it will
      discourage people from going into city centres which will make them more
      dangerous."

      Nottingham has a great community atmosphere, just go to the Canalside in
      summer..go to the Embankment. Unlike London where you can't even make eye
      contact on the tube without people thinking you're a nutter, generally, people
      in Notts are friendly. All areas have a few bad apples that spoil it for the
      majority but come on!"
