    text: "<b>Do you think that desalination is the best way to tackle water shortages?</b>
      <br /><br />Proposals for the UK's first desalination plant, which would take
      water from the tidal stretch of the Thames and turn it into drinking water, are
      to be discussed at a public inquiry.<br /><br />Thames Water is appealing
      against a decision made by London Mayor Ken Livingstone to block planning
      permission for the £200m plant. <br /><br /><b>Should water companies manage
      existing water supplies instead of looking for new ones? What are you doing to
      conserve water? Send us your comments.</b>"

    text: "Of course they should manage existing water better, its ridiculous that we have
      so much wastage by the companies AND the consumer. But desalination sounds like
      it makes sense to me - especially in the south east. <br /><br />Up here in the
      north west however, it feel a million miles away - I just want the rain to
      stop!!!"

    text: No its not really the answer for the UK. In some countries it may be the only way but here in the UK we have plenty of rainfall. The problem is really one of wasteage through leaking pipes and unnessaserry use of water.

      be spent on fixing the leaky pipes.  We do not have a water shortage in this

      after all what good is a new desalination plant if half of the water is lost en
      route?"

    text: Desalination is energy hungry in an age when energy is a war causing issue.<br /><br />Use of grey water systems and proper management of exisitngs supplies has to be the first place to start.<br /><br />It is wrong that we daily flush drinking water down our toilets when our used shower water would suffice.<br /><br />The cost of this would also be cheaper than desalination. Only once this has been done should we look at alternatives.
