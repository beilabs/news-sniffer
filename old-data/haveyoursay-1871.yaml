      installed?</b><br /><br />Sky has delayed the installation of HDTV in 17,000
      homes because its supplier has not delivered enough set-top boxes.<br /><br
      />HDTV promises higher quality pictures and audio through a compatible TV â€“
      signals broadcast in high definition have four to five times as much picture
      information than a standard TV signal.<br /><br /><b>Are you planning on getting
      HDTV? Should broadcasters be concentrating on a high-definition future? What are
      your experiences of installation?</b>"

    text: We have had Sky HD successfully installed today although we understand that many others have not been so lucky. The pictures are every bit as good as we expected displayed in 1080i resolution on a 42" plasma display. The BBC HD preview looks particularly good. I am a satisfied customer and the only thing I can say to those who are not going to get theirs installed on time is that the wait will be worth it.

      myself, being sold HD equipment only to later discover that further equipment

      originally.<br /><br />It'll be interesting to see how the BBC and ITV respond."
