    text: "<b>Is it right spend NHS money on complementary therapies, like homeopathy and
      acupuncture?</b><br /><br />Some of Britain's leading doctors have urged NHS
      trusts to stop using complementary therapies and to pay only for medicine
      \"based on solid evidence\".<br /><br />One doctor said the NHS was funding
      \"bogus\" therapies when patients struggled to get drugs like Herceptin. <br
      /><br />Prince Charles is to back complementary medicine in a speech to the
      World Health Assembly.<br /><br /><b>Do you use alternative medicine? Should the
      NHS fund complementary therapies, or should the money be spent elsewhere? Are
      you a patient or do you work in the NHS? Send us your views and
      experiences.</b>"

The argument here is really whether we should require proof that medicine works before we spend public money on it or whether we rely on anecdotes.  Right now we’re in the bizarre position where Herceptin has to rightly jump through hoops to get public money spent on it while complimentary medicine seems to get funded on the say so of a couple of hippies.
