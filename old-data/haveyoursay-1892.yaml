    text: "<b> How should divorce settlements be handled?</b><br /><br />The House of Lords
      will give a ruling on Wednesday concerning two divorce cases set to have a
      massive effect on the handling of financial settlements in England and Wales.<br
      /><br />In the first case, a former wife is claiming the right to share in the
      future income of her husband after giving up a high paid job to care for their
      children.<br /><br />A second case concerns a City fund manager contesting a Â£5
      million payment to his ex-wife mainly because they were married for less than
      three years and had no children.<br /><br /><b> How should the financial side of
      a divorce be settled? Does the current system work? Should pre-nuptial
      agreements be more acceptable? Send us your comments and experiences. </b>"
