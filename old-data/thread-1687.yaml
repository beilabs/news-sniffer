  text: Brown for PM? Surely not. He represents a Scottish constituency, and if my memory serves me right, Scotland has devolved powers. Similarly Reid at the Home Office (a generally devolved post) and Darling (Transport); the latter spending millions on Scottish Railways whilst England's branchlines face the axe. No Scots representing Scottish constituencies should be permitted to hold offices that effect England.
