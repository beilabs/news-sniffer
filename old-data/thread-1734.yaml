  text: It's allright for the Northerners as they can still use their horse and cart. Ooops wrong HYS posting.<br />Seriously though it will effect the people in isolated areas more as they will have the furthest to travel. I guess that's another subsidy for us Southerners - Cheers!

  text: I wish people would stop using the term 'motorists'. It's not a way of life, it's a necessity for millions of people. People talking about the 'cost' of motoring - think, please, think - the economy is based in large part on the internal combustion engine. Do you propose we rip up roads?? Please use your ******** brains.

  text: The absolute arrogance of this government beggars belief.<br /><br />we ALREADY pay Road Fund Tax, and thanks to Mr Brown we also pay EXORBITANT FURTHER TAX in FUEL DUTY.<br /><br />So don't kid yourselves, this is just another STEALTH TAX. About as stealthy as an elephant.<br /><br />As for you clowns that advocate using bicycles to get to work, try a 50 mile journey every morning and every evening in all weathers.<br /><br />Don't be so absolutely STUPID!!
