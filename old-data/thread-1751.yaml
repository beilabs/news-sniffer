  text: You could equally ask "Should companies that sold Zyklon B or the barbed wire to Auschwitz be denied their profits, when they knew exactly what they would be used for".<br />Investors knew of the activities they gain their blood tainted profits from when they bought shares, thus share the guilt they refuse to accept.<br />Better that they and the pro-testers support their views by volunteering for tests themselves but they clearly lack the courage or decency to do this.

  text: The malformed animal rights activists who undertake such brainless behaviour should be refused treatment by doctors where such treatment is a result of animal experimentation. They (the retards themselves)I am sure would not argue with this as it is representative of their views. If they die so much the better!
