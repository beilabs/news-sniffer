  text: How about the gender card. If women weren't working then salaries would be lowere as there is a smaller workforce therefore demand for houses is lower therefore house prices drop. Do you like that arguement? It is just as childish as blaming immigrants. Kick them out and all the jobs the "English" won't do will not be done and Britain will fall to its knees. The racism on this board is tiring.

  text: If you open your eyes you will see that its the imigrants that are popping out babies like peas in a pod and not the locals.All of them will need housing.<br /><br />[fudgeitall] <br />I dispute it, but if they did we would then have a population pyramid (lots of young people in jobs) which we dont have now and so could have a decent old age pension. Currently we are dying off with not enough locals having children - we need migrants for our doctors/ carers / teachers of the future. Look at Australia - migrants use NHS les and their children achieve better than locals. The Yobs overall are locals.

Why should they pay more? What right does someone who can not afford a home say 'give me yours?' What about hardworkers who buy a 2nd home at the end of their careers as they aim to live there? Or rent it out - to locals? - to help pay for it? Why should someone be penalised for trying to have an independent pension? Yes there are filthy rich with home  but here are hardworking people who have just got enough to buy a 2nd; they are not the same.  The Royal family has many homes what about them?

Migrant children are the doctors of tomorrow. Migrants use -worldwide-  the NHS less as they are trying to acheieve, not skive lots like the local popualtion.

Those who have more then one house should pay more taxes!!!<br />Emma Johnson, London, United Kingdom <br /><br />Yet another person who wants more benefits!
