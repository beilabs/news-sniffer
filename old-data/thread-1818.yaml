  text: Apart from being the ugliest aircraft in the skies, I simply don't trust Airbus jets.  They seem to crash too often, so I'd rather stick to Boeing.  In any event, the A380 is too big for most airports and will probably be a financial disaster.  No wonder BAe want to sell their share in Airbus Industries.  Boeing has got it right with the Dreamliner, which is more efficient and can fly further, and Airbus wont have an answer to that until 2012.
