  text: I think the writer of this book should be ashamed of himself. If this had been a film about islam or any other religion all hell would have broken loose but because christianity (not catholisim which is a false religion) preaches no revenge we are an easy target. Even the Romans who murdered Jesus admit he rose again on the third day. But this is just one of a long line of films and programmes to slate christianity and the bbc is one of the biggset guilty parties in this.

  text: It makes me laugh that a FILM taken from a BOOK can be classed as "blasphemous" just because it talks about a cult &#38; lets face it, christianity IS a cult no matter which way u look @ it. If people really do get offended by it then do the proper thing &#38; NOT worry about it. Every one has thoughts &#38; believes that will always contradict others. Live with it.

  text: I think this whole 'Da Vinci Code Debate' which we are seeing all over the media currently is literally a distraction away from the real issues taking place as we speak, for instance, 9/11 being a provable inside job.

  text: "\"Does Phil Gale not realise that all religious works are peices of 'historical fiction' including the bible.\" - Richard Davie, UK<br /><br />Actually, that can't be proven either; it's a matter of your lack of belief. I sense a desire, on the part of many HYS non-believers, to impose your lack of faith on others; a blatant intolerance based on arrogance. There's an amusing contradiction that you arrived at this closed minded position by being rational."

  text: "\"I have every right to question and criticise religious beliefs if I want to.\" - Max Lewis, UK<br /><br />Do Christians also have a right to question and criticize your beliefs or lack there of? Do Christians have a right to defend their beliefs?<br /><br />I'm not very religious; but I notice a lack of tolerance by leftists for anything Christian. Will you leftists admit that? I notice some rationalize their intolerance because of their percieved superior postion."

  text: All the catholics here have said "The Da Vinci Code is Fiction", well, that is true, but the theory of Jesus married Magdalena is very old and is in books that are not FICTION, are books of HISTORY so don't use that excuse anymore.<br /><br />oh, I almost forgot, the bible is FICTION.
