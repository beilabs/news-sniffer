  text: Sadly the hydra-effect is present - Al-Zarqawi just one head of an organisation which is not structural (as the Americans presented)but ideological.The same propaganda-crowing will be made today,as it was over Saddam's sons &#38; when Saddam was caught.But it will still go on, someone mentioned internecine warfare between muslims as if this was all that was going on.He must have missed the occupying forces of a non-Muslim disposition that are a major part of the problem

  text: The impact of individuals on events can be huge ranging from Gandhi to Hitler and is often underestimated.  Al-Zarqawi was an important force for violent intolerance and his death is one key step out of the current morass in the Middle East and in relations between Islam and non Islamic countries.<br />Graham

  text: Good news and it will undoubtedly disrupt the organisation of the resistance whilst they regroup.  But this does not remove the cause of the problem which as we know is much more deep rooted.  <br /><br />Even better news is this might even keep Rooneys foot off the front pages for a day or 2...

  text: Unfortunately one live lunatic is less of problem than a dead martyr for hundreds of other lunatics to idolise and emulate.<br /><br />I guess we have to track these people down. But until there is a credible Iraqi administration in place and we are out of Iraq these a minor victories in the great scheme of things.<br /><br />Killing people just creates martyr's for others to follow.

  text: Zarqawi's death is irrelevant. He was never that important in the scheme of things until the US made him public enemy number 1 as a way of focussing on the 'Al-qaeda' threat. The real challenge is to stop the real home grown resistance freedom fighters, because that is what it is. These ordinary Iraqi militias are fighting, according to them, an occupier who lied to create a situation they had choreographed from the moment 9/11 occurred.

  text: This must be a sad day for Respect, Guardian readers, Robert Fisk and other fellow travellers of the "insurgency", but of course it is only one man and one who by some accounts was already becoming marginalised. Someone will have already taken his place. Good news nonetheless.<br /><br />Also, F Khan, in general I agree with youre principle, but if violence only ever begets more violence how come wars ever end? Sometimes violence must be met with violence too!

  text: Al-Zarqawi was a leading Jihadist in the Global scenario of Islamic Terrorism. They do not believe in Democracy, Our Courts, Our Values etc., They believe only in Quran, Sharia which are outdated in the current context.He is getting a Hero worship because of the untimely foolish decision of US occupying Iraq which has allowed to flourish in Iraq.<br /><br />We have to completely liquidate the Jihadism from the Earth. Otherwise the same things will be repeated againa and again.
