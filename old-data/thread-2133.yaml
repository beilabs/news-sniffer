  text: Mike Malone are you suggesting with your comment "There are some of us out here with IQ's in double figures who find football boring, tedious and of no entertainment value at all." that most of the people who don't like football have IQs in single figures?<br /><br />Although, having an IQ in double figures still means that you are of below average intelligence! Perhaps if you had an IQ of three figures you mighe be able to enjoy it!
