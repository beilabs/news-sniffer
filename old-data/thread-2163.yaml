  text: Richie H, Secret <br /><br />I know illegals who do abide by most of the rules. I know most don't and a lot locals nare just just as bad living of the state. I do live in the real world. I wonder how many asylum seekers you know? Not many meethinks. You are right about the poll though. I also like the way some right wingers use personal insults as a way of arguing. Very clever.

  text: ...." I bet they have jobs and pay tax ..."<br /><br />Right on the first count, wrong on the second !<br /><br />There 12 million more NI numbers in circulation than people known to exist in the UK. And half of them got tax credits and benefits !<br /><br />That's why we will have to pay to have our bins emptied ....

  text: Leftwing lefty<br /><br />You are a disgrace, illegal immigrants are a drain on the economy, they travel here illegally, bin their papers, request mobile phones, get free houses, etc, etc.  I am sick of them, and would rather see them in their own country than living here for free.  Then they complain when they are deported and even threaten to kill their own babies or soil themselves to stay here.  <br /><br />What use are they to the economy.  Shut the borders?

  text: Richie H<br /><br />Your comments are laughable. Calling illegal immigrants waste? You may not want them but they are still human and are not comparable to the rubbish you throw away. And burning Mrs Blair on a stick isn't that an arrestable offence. <br /><br />Trash tax may be the only way in the future to reduce waste although personally I am not sure about it.
