  text: "I agree with Guidos,<br /><br />Fact: the human population fo earth is growing exponentially.<br /><br />A story about exponential growth: <br /><br />Bacteria repdroduce exponentially. That is, the time for the population to double is constant. Imagine we have a jar of nutrient. At 11AM we place a single bacterium of a species that divides once per minute, in the jar. One hour later, at noon, we note that the jar is full of bacteria. <br /><br />Question: At what time was the jar half full? Answer: 11:59<br /><br />Its one minute to noon people. Control your reproduction."
