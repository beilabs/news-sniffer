  text: I have never taken a day off for a fake illness; not even when we were struggling to look after a sick child (one of us did stay at home legitimately on those occasions).   Indeed I have had no sick leave so far this year, and had only one day off sick last year.<br /><br />However, my employer gives me reasonable holidays.  We have a decent flexi-time system, and for family emergencies (such as a sick child) it is possible to request unpaid leave (which I have used from time to time).

  text: Why do football fans think they that they should be treated differently from the rest of us?<br /><br />Neil Wallace, Sheffield, United Kingdom <br /><br />To put it humorously, Neil, motor sports are watched by sad gits with who are a tiny minority of the population. Football is part of the social fabric of this country and has been for at least 700 years. That is why football deserves special treatment. CMON ENGLAND!!
