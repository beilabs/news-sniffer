  text: When I lived in Tunbridge Wells I found it to be a pretty enough place - lots of green space, lovely pubs &#38; surrounded by the most glorious countryside. Pity then that it's populated by the most arrogant, selfish and loathsome people.<br />Cardiff, on the other hand, is a vast building site right now, but I'd rather live here because the people are a breath of fresh air - tolerant, welcoming and generous.<br />It's the people that make a city great, not buildings.

  text: Bert Puttocks<br /><br />Can't get over your screamingly funny name. I've just emailed to all my friends. Well I would have done if I was 8 years old. I can see why London disappointed you. You're just too sophisticated for the metropolis.<br /><br />Your wound a little tight there Phil, some people are so easy to wind up. Are you sure you have friends?

  text: Chelsea is full of chavs.<br /><br />Marc Kay, New York, United States <br /><br />Everywhere is full of Chavs. The underclass are the only section of the population that's increasing.
