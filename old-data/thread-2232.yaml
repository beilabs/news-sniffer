  text: I agree Peter,<br /><br />It just seems to me that Banks are desperate to fling as much money at you as possible.<br />And god forbid if you get speaking to one of their financial advisors........<br /><br />I thought they were supposed to advise on the best way of spreading your assets....Oh no sorry that must be cuckoo land, they just want to flog you something.. sigh

  text: What difference would changes in taxation make?<br />Surely most people who go to loan sharks are unemployed or don't pay tax anyway.<br /><br />If you can't afford it, don't damn well buy it.<br /><br />Loan sharks = A tax on the stupid

  text: Captain Dave The Hat- there is a very strict code of lending that banks should follow. Indeed Lloyds have been punished fairly severely for lending huge sums to people who are totally incapable of paying it back.<br /><br />However... your ability to pay is more than just your income. Number of kids, and where you live (eg. London being much more expensive than Bradford) is equally important.
