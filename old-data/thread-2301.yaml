  text: "I don't really care what all of you here think, what Israel should do is give a last ultimatum, release him in one hour or all of Gaza will be flattened and your leaders killed. Enough talking and doing nothing, if your country was constantly attacked and bombed by \xE2\x80\x98freedom fighters\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98militants\xE2\x80\x99 or \xE2\x80\x98terrorists\xE2\x80\x99 (who cares about the definition) you would have expected you leaders to do something about it and not wait for the rest of the world to argue your case."
