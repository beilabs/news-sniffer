  text: I still can't believe the elementary belief that this Zionist action is about  the capture of that french jew...This is a smokescreen for the paper soldier- wanna be Sharon...This action is not justified...Unfortunately, as long as the US is a superpower, nothing will happen to the Zionist...Looking at history, however, I realized that it took 400 years for the Spanish to liberate Spain...

  text: ISRAEL'S borders were given by GOD in the HOLY BIBLE The PLO has no right to be in Isreal tho I do have pity for a displaced people used like puppets by their own Leadership.<br />Deborah Runkle, Las Vegas, Nevada<br />If that wasn't so sad it would be funny. Monty Python at their best couldn't come up with a sketch better than that. The sooner Israel disappears, the more pleasant and safer the world will be. And as for that hideous book you mentioned

  text: Israeli attacks on the poor hapless people of Gaza are a shame on all humanity which allows this to go on without any reaction from the world's major government. The parallels between what the Israeli's are doing to the refuges of Gaza and what the heinous Nazis did to the Jewish people in the Warsaw Ghetto are just too much for people with some knowledge of history.
