  text: I think the real question is not about Zidane but about Italian football. The Italians won without once showing us creative and exciting football. What they are good at is walking as close to edge as is allowed by the current rules. They dive, foul, and use childish physcological games like the insults meted out to Zidane, because they are incapable of winning games on the strength of their football. Without a doubt the least deserving champions ever.
