  text: "There\xE2\x80\x99s only one solution to Islamic terrorism; all countries that provide financial &#38; human support to terrorists must be utterly annihilated. <br />Brad Chicago <br /><br />What about the US support for the IRA in the 80s and 90s Brad? Was that not supporting terorrism? By your own reconking, the US should have been annihilated a long time ago.<br />States under attack should take a step back and look at why they're being attacked (ie their own policies) , rather than blame someone else."

  text: "\"This clealy the fault of the West, and particularly the U.S. and the U.K.<br />If they hadn't arrogantly partitioned Pakistan the climate would not have existed to create feelings such that this have happened.<br /><br />Thomas, Dubai\"<br /><br />There also wouldn't've been an India as it is, since there was more independence in the constituent kingdoms. My faith in human nature leads me to believe that there would likely be more conflict in the region."
