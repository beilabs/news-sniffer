  text: Its time people woke up to the fact that the Israeli's are the problem. All over the world, they hold positions of power through self enrichment. They are greedy people who want more more more, no matter how much they have, they want more...thats just in their nature.<br /><br />katy baynes, Western Cape <br /><br />Thank you for the single most inane comment of the day. Please elaborate sighting examples. I will enjoy your response as you dig yourself deeper into the intellectually stupid pit you have dug

  text: The Beirut International Airport is used by the Hezbollah to transfer missiles from Iran via Demascus. These missiles are then fired on Israeli cities.<br /><br />The same applies to the Beirut-Demascus highway.<br /><br />For this reason both were targeted.

  text: "Chris Ward, London says: \"If the US stopped pouring billions of dollars into Israel, the latter might not be able to finance its enormous army and continual attacks.\"<br /><br />Mind you, Israel won the Six Day War in 1967 without help from the USA so I'm sure it can manage without the billions of dollars (which by the way, are also given to other Middle East countries too!), since Israel's will to survive and protect its citizens is far stronger than the Arab terrorists' will to destroy Israel."

  text: "My comment is inclined towards the future status of the state of Israel: \xE2\x80\x9CIsrael, having grown immensely strong since its birth in 1948, will soon become the ruling state in the world, and hence it would replace the USA as the ruling state in the world. It might be at that time when Israel expands her territory from the river Nile in Egypt to the Euphrates in present day Iraq, and at this moment in time, it can only be accomplished by a war, a great war. It\xE2\x80\x99s already beginning. That's my opinion"

How many humiliating losses will it take?...\" <br />American Jewess, Jerusalem <br /><br />The racism, hatred and vitriol is literally dripping from this post. If this managed to get past moderation then I'm quite justified in saying that this is all we could \"expect\" from the perspective of an American Jewess! How sad!"

  text: Now it is more clear who killed Hariri a year ago to assure Syrian soldiers are out of Lebanon and country will be left with weak military. Hezbullah is a political party and it is same as IRA. They are not a terrorist organization just because Bush is telling so. They are protecting their country and this is an example of an event why they are needed. I hope that world can see now the real face of Isreal who is doing the second holocost in the history

  text: Tony Blair and George Bush sort out the problem! The behaviour of Israel is unacceptable! They have killed innocent people. It is appaling you stand by and let them get away with it. And why? Because the bloody Jews hold the power in America. There is no excuse for their actions. Unless you also want to be held accountable as well, I suggest to you that the time for diplomacy is over.

  text: Hezbollah and Syria is a plague that innocent Lebanese have suffered with for long enough. I cannot have any sympathy for a group that uses innocent humans as shields. No excuses, no spin Hezbollah started this and can end it by giving back the two prisoners and moving away from the boarder and letting the Lebanese government put troops in-between.

  text: Blair is remaining very non comittal on this. It's about time he started to think for himself rather than continue to act as Bush's puppy dog. I always thought Blair was more intelligent than Bush, but now I know they only have a few brain cells to share between them. <br /><br />The continuing support of the Israelis is a disgrace. Only a neutral can even begin to enter into talks about peace.

  text: I do not believe the conflict will ever end, there will be lulls but the fighting will go on. The muslim fighters know nothing else and their manhood/ status is defined by what they do/ achieve in the conflict. Peace would "kill" these fighters as they would not know what to do with themselves. They would not be sure of getting into "paradise" in peace time, only by fighting and dying in the "holy war".<br />The war therefore must go on.

  text: In 1945 it was clear that the Jewish people, even those who had spent WW2 in safety, would require several decades and generations of peace and tranquility to overcome the Trauma of the Holocaust. But this period of healing has not yet even started as they have been under constant attack ever since from people lacking morals and decency who follow a religion of hate. They have been forced to stand up for themselves. They know that pacifism will bring defeat again. Remember this and support them.

  text: I get seek and tired reading comments about Israel applying "excessive" force in this conflict. I have a bit of military experience myself and let me assure you Israel has shown utmost restraint so far. IDF is facing the terrorists who are hiding behind human shields, INCLUDING the UN observers. Israeli soldiers are dying in battle precisely because they want to spare civilian lives. Stop drawing comparisons between a civilized nation with civilized military and bloodthirsty gangsters.

When are liberals going to get their heads out of the sand and stop hand-wringing? Jihadist militants will use any excuse to attack Israel, USA, Britain, Darfur, Thailand, Russia etc. We should be standing shoulder to shoulder with the USA and Israel.
