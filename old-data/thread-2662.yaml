  text: "[citizenloz], Crowthorne, United Kingdom  \"I am all for global warming if this is the consequence. Just off to spray a few more aerosols, break open some old fridges and leave the car engine running to make sure!\"<br /><br />You're confusing two issues: CFC's in fridges destroy the ozone layer.... that doesn't make it any warmer it just makes the chances of you getting skin cancer go through the roof."

  text: Global warming is now scientific fact. However, this hot spell I would argue has nothing to do with global warming whatsoever. Temperatures will always fluctuate, there has always been extreme hot/cold periods. Global warming is leading mainly to a rise in average temperatures, and this is mainly felt across the year. Therefore, the most likely effect of global warming is simply more frequent mild &#38; wetter winters. Unless melting ice caps cause the cessation or diversion of the jet stream of course, in which case we'll have a climate similar to northern alaska...

  text: "DM, Ayr \"India has to be one of the hottest countries in the world and their railways don't seem to stop because of it. I'd like to know exactly what the operating temperatures of the railway are in the UK, one day it's too hot then the next it's too cold !\"<br /><br />Have you ever been on an indian train? 20mph is a good speed on certain lines because the tracks are so warped. You can run faster than most of their services! A better example would be Japan: their rails don't warp in the heat because they're hugely thick and much more expensive than ours. If we used bullet train tracks we'd be paying bullet train fares."

  text: We would get arrested Dave if we walked topless through the town centre, &#38; quite rightly so. But the beach or park is perfectly acceptable.<br /><br />Bethany Summer <br /><br /><br />That's my point, Bethany, WHY? It's a public place, so the same laws apply. Don't get my wrong, I like boobs. So long as they are not on over weight and/or ugly women.

  text: dave morraine- I'd check the law... its probably legal for women to go topless in towns. Many laws like this only apply to men. For instance women can "relieve" themselves in public, but men can't.
