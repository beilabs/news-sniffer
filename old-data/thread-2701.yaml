  text: Why does Isreal get away with terror? Few months ago a palestinian family was massacred on the beech and there was no apology or condemnation from the USA or UK.  We see majority of civilians dead in this conflict. The Zionist army is killing palestinians daily inside their own country and no media reports it. Now the foreign people in Lebanon can get a feel of what palestinians get every day in palestine. Isn't it about time we are fair to both sides?
