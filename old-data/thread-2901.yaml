  text: We should be doing more to support Israel. Firstly, the EU could send more airplanes and munitions for Israel to use at their discretion who are best placed to assess security threats in the middle east. Lets help Israel eradicate fundamentalism, the west has enough fire power to encourage the Islamic world to revert to a responsible and respectful way of life.

  text: Considering what happen to Jews during the history, Israel should be the most activist for the human rights, but unfortunately it is the worst violator of the human rights in the world.<br />Israel keep reminding us that hezbollah is a terrorist organisation since it is targeting civilians. What would that make Israel? In that definition Israel is the biggest terrorist of all on the entire earth. Shame on you Israel, Shame on you US for being so blood thirsty. You are worst than any of your enemies.

  text: Israel is doing exactly what the US/UK should have done and be doing to crush militant terrorism. These people hold no value for human life as evidenced in Iraq and Afghanistan. Terrorism is a dirty war and we in the West must use whatever means necessary to crush these lunatic funamentalist terrorists who have publicly stated they want to see the eradication of the state of Israel and have every country a fundamentalist Islamist state. Enough with the liberal whingers and Islamist apologists.
